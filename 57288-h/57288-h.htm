<br />ECHOS OF THE PAST</h2>
<p>Under the arching roof of a tremendous cave stands a silent,
empty city.</p>
<p>For almost seven centuries it has stood there looking out
across the canyon toward the setting sun. Proudly, almost
haughtily, it has resisted the heavy tread of those slow centuries.
Like a giant with a shawl of everlasting stone pulled
closely about its shoulders it has stood with unbowed head, an
eternal monument to the intelligence and industry of its
builders.</p>
<p>Almost seven centuries ago the people turned their backs
on their proud city and walked away. All of the forces of nature
seemed to be against them. The rains failed to fall; the
springs ceased to flow. No corn grew in the fields. At last,
weak from lack of food and water, and bewildered by the failure
of the gods to answer their hysterical prayers they surrendered
to the inevitable. Sadly they turned their backs on the
once happy city and walked down the canyon, never to return.</p>

silent, deserted city.</p>
<p>In spite of the protection offered by the cave Cliff Palace
has suffered from the leveling forces of time. The owls and
pack rats have been careless tenants and the lack of repair is
evident. Some of the walls have cracked; a few have fallen.
Foundations have slipped; roofs have disappeared. The once-bright
plaster is peeling from the walls.</p>
<p>These minor changes have failed to dim the splendor of the
largest of all cliff dwellings. From one end of the cave to the
other stand unbroken lines of houses. Story upon story they
rise to the very roof of the cave itself. On a still higher ledge,
far up under the cave roof, stands a long row of small rooms
where the people once stored their abundant supplies of grain.
In some of the houses paintings are still bright on the walls; in
others footprints of the people are still clearly evident in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
hard-packed clay floors. At each end of the cave is the trail
which once led to the corn fields on the mesa top; below the
cave is the trail that led to the bottom of the canyon.</p>
<p>In reality Cliff Palace has not changed a great deal since
that day when its inhabitants disappeared. They walked away,
it is true, but they are still there. You can see them if you
close your eyes.</p>
<p>Unfortunate indeed, is he who views this ancient city and
sees only the towering walls. Unfortunate because the stones
are the least important part. Cliff Palace is really built of the
hopes and desires, the joys and sorrows of an industrious people.
It is not a cold, empty city for it is still warm with the
emotions of its builders. In each fingerprint and tool mark lie
the prayers of a young couple for a home filled with children
and happiness. Each storage bin is chinked with a farmer&rsquo;s
prayers for a bountiful harvest. In each plastered kiva wall is
an ancient priest&rsquo;s reverence for his gods. A pot is not just a
piece of baked clay: it is an ancient potter&rsquo;s moulded prayer
for beauty and strength. Each solid wall is a testimony of success;
each shattered human bone, each broken jar is an admission
of defeat.</p>
<p>Cliff Palace stands today as a monument to the ancient people
of the Mesa Verde. For many centuries they occupied the
great, green mesa and finally, almost in its center, they built
their greatest city. Certainly it was their outstanding architectural
achievement but it is only one of many hundreds of
ruins which stand in silent testimony to the skills of an industrious
people.</p>
<p>For over a thousand years the Indians enjoyed the security
and bounty of the Mesa Verde. In the beginning their culture
was simple but as the centuries passed they progressed steadily
without taking a backward step. Finally they reached the highest
point of their development and for the brief century during
which they occupied the cliff dwellings they enjoyed the fruits
of their long struggle. Then catastrophe came and in a short
time they were gone.</p>

<p>The complete archeological wealth of the Mesa Verde will
never be known. The great mesa, which rises high above the
surrounding country, measures fifteen miles from north to
south and twenty miles from east to west. Its flat top, sloping
gently to the south, is cut by a score of rugged canyons and
access to the remote areas is difficult. The ruins are often
hard to find and many will never be discovered. In the days of
discovery, as we shall see in the next chapter, the early explorers
entered almost every cliff dwelling but they left few
records. In recent times it is doubtful if one-third of the cliff
dwellings have been entered and probably no living person has
been in one hundred of them.</p>
<p>The ruins on the mesa tops far outnumber the cliff dwellings
but most of them are difficult to find. Earth and vegetation have
covered them, often completely, and intensive search does not
reveal all. This wealth of mesa-top ruins is indicated by a recent
survey of a small portion of one mesa. Careful search of
an area of only three square miles revealed over three hundred
ruins.</p>
<p>In 1906, one-half of the great mesa was set aside as Mesa
Verde National Park in order that the ruins might be preserved
for all time and made accessible to visitors. Cliff Palace and
some of the other cliff dwellings have been excavated and out
on the mesa tops ruins of earlier types have been excavated to
complete the archeological story. In the nearby museum are
to be seen the things which have been found in the ruins. Displayed
in their chronological order they tell the story of the
ancient inhabitants of the Mesa Verde.</p>
<p>It is a fascinating story of a vanished people. For endless
centuries they dominated the Mesa Verde, passing through
higher and higher stages of culture. When an unendurable calamity
forced them to leave they left behind abundant evidence
of their skill and industry. With the care they now receive
Cliff Palace, Spruce Tree House, Sun Temple and the innumerable
other ruins will stand forever as monuments to the
skill of their ancient builders.</p>
<p>Mesa Verde National Park was created to preserve the
works of those prehistoric people. Slow, silent centuries have
spread a cloak of mystery over it and visitors should come with
open minds, prepared to hear an absorbing story of a strange
people. Complete enjoyment and understanding come only to
the visitor who is able to leave his modern self behind, momentarily,
and live and think in terms of the past.</p>

<br />DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>After the cliff dwellings were deserted by the Pueblo Indians
late in the thirteenth century they stood, unmolested by man,
for many hundreds of years. The owls and pack rats took
them over and enjoyed their security, but from all evidence it
was many centuries before men again entered the caves.</p>
<p>The Indians themselves may have intended to return when
conditions became normal again but they never came back.
There is no evidence that farming Indians ever lived in the
Mesa Verde after its desertion by the ancient people. Other
Indians came but they were hunters and they seem to have
shunned the silent cave cities.</p>
<p>A couple of centuries after Mesa Verde was deserted an
important event took place, an event that was to have a strange
effect on it at a later date.</p>
<p>America was rediscovered!</p>
<p>Fifteen thousand years after the Indians discovered the continent
from the west, white men entered it from the east. A
new people blundered into the western hemisphere that had so
long belonged to the Indians.</p>
<p>The newcomers were a greedy lot and they began to stretch
acquisitive fingers in all directions. Mexico was colonized and
tales of wealth among the Indians to the north led the Spaniards
into the Southwest. In 1540, Coronado was only 150 miles from
the Mesa Verde but he turned away. Other Spaniards came
nearer and nearer until at last, in the year 1776, they were at
the base of the great green mesa.</p>
<p>On August 10, 1776, only thirty-seven days after the signing
of the Declaration of Independence, Escalante, a Spanish priest,
camped in the very shadow of the Mesa Verde. It seems almost
incredible that at a time when the colonists along the Atlantic
seaboard knew nothing of the vast wilderness beyond the
first range of mountains, Escalante and his men were here in
the land of the cliff dwellings. Seeking a short route to Monterey,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
on the Pacific Coast, they had journeyed northwest from Santa
Fe. At last, on August 10, 1776, they camped by a small stream
at the base of the La Plata Mountains.</p>
<p>In his diary Escalante wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;August 10. Father Fray Francisco Atanasio awoke troubled
by a rheumatic fever which he had felt in his face and head
since the day before, and it was desirable that we make camp
here until he should be better, but the continuous rains, the inclemency
of the weather, and the great dampness of the place
forced us to leave it. Going north, and having traveled a little
more than half a league, we turned to the northwest, went on a
league and then swung west through valleys of very beautiful
timber and abundant pasturage, roses, and various other flowers.
After going two leagues we were again caught in a very
heavy rain. Father Fray Francisco Atanasio became worse
and the road impassable, and so, having traveled with great
difficulty two more leagues to the west, we had to camp on the
bank of the first of the two little rivers which form the San
Lazaro, otherwise called Rio de los Mancos. The pasturage
continues in great abundance. Today four and a half leagues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small stream beside which Escalante camped that night
is still called the Mancos. Only a few miles below his camping
place it cuts directly into the Mesa Verde. The former inhabitants
of the cliff dwellings had known it well. It had failed them
during the great drouth. And now, on August 10, 1776, exactly
500 years after the beginning of that drouth which had caused
them to leave the Mesa Verde, Escalante, a man of a new race,
camped beside the Mancos, only a few miles from the empty
ruins of the cliff dwellings.</p>
<p>Without doubt he saw the great mesa, the Mesa Verde, for
it looms high above the Mancos Valley. But he turned away;
he was seeking the sea to the west.</p>
<p>During the following three-quarters of a century many other
Spaniards must have seen the Mesa Verde for there was much
exploration in the region. Sometime during this period the
mesa was given a Spanish name&mdash;Mesa Verde&mdash;the &ldquo;green
table.&rdquo; The Spaniard who named it is unknown. Possibly he
named it after climbing to its summit for from the valley below
it is not so evident that the top is flat and eternally green.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Could it be that he even saw the cliff dwellings and we have
failed to find the record in the musty archives of Mexico or
Spain? No, probably not. We must consider that the cliff
dwellings were still unseen by modern man.</p>
<p>In 1848, the Mesa Verde, although still unknown, passed
from Mexican to American ownership. Slowly the new owners
drew nearer. The date of discovery of the now aged cliff dwellings
was close at hand.</p>
<p>The first known mention of the Mesa Verde was made in the
year 1859. In that year an exploring expedition set out from
Santa Fe, under the leadership of Captain J. N. Macomb, to explore
certain territory in what is now the State of Utah. Serving
as geologist for this expedition was Professor J. S. Newberry
and in his geological report he wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between the Rio de la Plata and the Rio de los Mancos we
skirted the base of the extreme southern point of the Sierra de
la Plata. These mountains terminate southward in a long slope,
which falls down to a level of about 7500 feet above the sea,
forming a plateau which extends southward to the San Juan, the
Mesa Verde, to which I shall soon have occasion again to refer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farther on in his report he adds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To obtain a just conception of the enormous denudation
which the Colorado Plateau has suffered, no better point of view
could possibly be selected than that of the summit of the Mesa
Verde. The geologist here has, it seems to me, satisfactory
proof of the proposition I have before made....&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the manner in which he spoke of the Mesa Verde it is
very evident Professor Newberry voiced a name that was in
common usage. This was true also of all the rivers and mountains
mentioned in his report. Their names indicate the Spaniards
had done a very thorough job of christening the landmarks
of the region.</p>
<p>From Newberry&rsquo;s report it is also evident that he climbed
to the summit of the Mesa Verde. His description indicates he
must have scaled one of the high points along the northern rim,
possibly Park Point, the highest of all. He merely climbed to
the summit, feasted his geological eyes on the thrilling view
over 16,000 square miles of wilderness, and descended. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
was only a few miles from the ruins but he failed to suspect
their presence. He does deserve credit, however, for the first
known mention of the Mesa Verde and for the earliest modern
ascent to its summit.</p>
<p>The first American settlers entered the Mesa Verde region
about 1870. Miners, farmers, trappers, cattlemen, even bandits,
came pouring into the Mancos Valley and found it to their
liking. None of them had ever heard of, or would have been
interested in the ruins. To them the past was dead and forgotten;
they were looking ahead. They were interested only in
taming the wilderness and in keeping their scalps firmly attached
to their heads.</p>
<p>At that time the entire region was terrorized by the Ute Indians.
Naturally a war-like group they were goaded into a
frenzy by the loss of their hunting grounds and they made life
miserable for the whites. Adventurous miners and trappers
were slain; farming settlements lived in constant fear of the
merciless warriors. The situation became acute and soldiers
finally were sent in to hold the Utes in check.</p>
<p>To the settlers the Indians were simple hazards to be expected
in the conquest of the wilderness. They were merely to
be brushed aside. If they resented the brushing process, if they
showed a tendency to resist the loss of their ancient tribal
homes, it was very unfortunate&mdash;for the Indians. The persuasive
little leaden pellets of the settlers convinced one Ute after
another that it was wrong to resent the loss of homes and hunting
grounds. The remnants of the tribe sought refuge in natural
strongholds, especially in strongholds where there was nothing
desired by the whites.</p>
<p>One of these natural strongholds was the Mesa Verde. Its
warm lower canyons had long been the winter home of bands of
Utes and they were familiar with every nook and cranny in it.
The deep, narrow canyons and high mesas offered sanctuary to
the oppressed Indians. The settlers in the Mancos Valley respected
this wilderness stronghold and it remained a place of
mystery to them. From the time of Professor Newberry&rsquo;s
climb to the summit in 1859, we have no definite record of white
men entering the Mesa Verde until 1874.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>In that year a small party of explorers ventured into the
forbidding canyons of the great mesa. The young government
far off to the east was endeavoring to learn the extent and nature
of its newly acquired possessions in the far west. Small
surveying parties were being sent into all parts of the vast unknown
land. One of these parties drifted down from the north
and entered the Mesa Verde region in the year 1874. In charge
of the party was Mr. W. H. Jackson, photographer for the U. S.
Geological and Geographical Survey. Jackson and his men were
not interested in the Mesa Verde, in fact they had no knowledge
of its existence until men whom they encountered in some of
the mining camps began to tell of a great tableland filled with
mysterious ruins.</p>
<p>Jackson was intrigued and although he had little faith in the
strange rumors, he decided to explore the Mesa Verde. His
guide on the expedition was a garrulous miner named John Moss
who claimed to have first-hand knowledge of the ruins. This
chapter in the story of the Mesa Verde is extremely vague.
There is no doubt that before the time of Jackson&rsquo;s expedition
some of the settlers knew of the Mesa Verde ruins. How much
they knew is uncertain. Some of the early prospectors or hunters
may actually have seen them. The Mancos Canyon afforded
a natural avenue for travel through the Mesa Verde and in spite
of the Ute danger, the intrepid adventurers may have used it
occasionally. If they did, they could hardly have failed to see
the many ruins that clung to the faces of the cliffs far above
the river.</p>
<p>On the other hand, knowledge of the Mesa Verde ruins may
have come from the Indians. In a little while we will see a
friendly Ute Indian giving the white men their first knowledge
of Cliff Palace. Perhaps John Moss and the other miners heard
of the existence of the ruins from friendly Utes or Navahos.</p>
<p>At any rate, John Moss knew that there were ruins in the
Mesa Verde, and in September, 1874, he led Jackson into the
Mancos Canyon. The first night they camped on the banks of
the river in the heart of the Mesa Verde. A century earlier
Escalante had camped a few miles farther up the same stream.
Six centuries earlier Indian maidens had filled their water jars
from it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>No cliff dwellings had been seen and the men were beginning
to lose faith in the stories of their guide. As dusk was settling
over the canyon, the men stood about their campfire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moss,&rdquo; one of the men questioned, &ldquo;where are those ruins
that you have been telling us about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right up there,&rdquo; Moss replied, with a swing of his arm
that took in the whole out-of-doors.</p>
<p>Unimpressed, the men stepped away from the campfire and
began to scan the cliffs above. In the bottom of the canyon they
stood in the gathering shadows of twilight but far above the
cliffs were lighted by the last dying embers of the setting sun.
Suddenly the men saw what John Moss had not even suspected
when he had said, &ldquo;Right up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the topmost cliff was a cave and in it, standing out in bold
relief against the shadowy background, were small stone houses.
Moss was right&mdash;there was a ruin &ldquo;up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the growing darkness the men scrambled up the
canyon walls. Just as total darkness fell, two of them entered
the little cliff dwelling. It was the earliest known discovery of
a Mesa Verde cliff dwelling by white men.</p>
<p>The next morning Jackson and his men returned to the ruin
and photographed it. Two-Story Cliff House they named it because
of a splendidly-built, two-story structure it contained.
Excitedly they climbed about the small village, poking into
every dark corner. In the debris of the cluttered rooms they
found things that aided them in their wild speculations about
the vanished people; pottery, corn cobs, stone tools&mdash;the Mesa
Verde was beginning to give up its secrets.</p>
<p>Today Two-Story Cliff House still clings to the face of its
cliff. It has changed little since Jackson saw it and few men
have entered it since that fatal day when the Indians left it behind.</p>
<p>Long ago the people of Two-Story House were neighbors of
the people of Cliff Palace, the great cliff dwelling toward which
we are moving. To them it must have been a metropolis, a
great city, the largest they ever knew. It took only an hour for
them to trot up the canyon to the larger community. Often the
men of the little village must have slung their prized possessions
over their shoulders and set out for Cliff Palace on trading and
gambling expeditions. It was &ldquo;big town&rdquo; to them.</p>

<p class="pcap">Two Story Cliff House, discovered by Mr. W. H. Jackson, in 1874</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>When Jackson was at Two-Story Cliff House he was very
near Cliff Palace but he did not see the larger ruin. If he had
gone only four miles up the nearest side canyon, he would have
found the amazing structure. But he was satisfied with the discovery
of Two-Story Cliff House and other small ruins and a
narrowly-averted clash with a band of Utes sent him scuttling
down the Mancos Canyon and out of the Mesa Verde to safety.
Cliff Palace was still unknown but the threat of discovery was
coming nearer.</p>
<p>One of the early settlers in the Mancos Valley was Mr. B.
K. Wetherill, a rancher. In the eighties he and his five sons
were living on a large ranch at the foot of the Mesa Verde. It
was a typical pioneer family but in one respect the Wetherills
were very different from their neighbors. Throughout all of
their years of residence in the valley they had been friendly
with the Utes. Instead of persecuting them as so many of the
settlers did, they befriended the helpless Indians who were
rapidly losing the lands they regarded as their own. Indians
were welcome at the Wetherill ranch and the bonds of friendship
grew strong.</p>
<p>As a result of this friendship, the Wetherills began to run
their cattle in the Mancos Canyon. At last, white men were
welcome in the vast stronghold of the Utes. Deeper and deeper
they penetrated into the network of canyons.</p>
<p>As they worked with their cattle the Wetherills began to notice
tiny houses standing in caves on the faces of the cliffs.
They even climbed to them and as they explored the little villages
their interest and curiosity mounted. The houses were
merely small stone rooms, evidently built in the caves for security.
In the houses the boys found things the ancient inhabitants
had left behind, even the remains of the people themselves.
They speculated on the origin of their finds but there seemed
to be no answers. The objects found seemed to have no actual
value so they spent little time in the ancient buildings. Their
cattle could not be neglected for the tiny houses in the cliffs.</p>
<p>An interesting tale came to the Wetherill brothers&rsquo; ears
when they became acquainted with a Ute Indian named Acowitz.
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
In some of the canyons, he told them, were cliff dwellings that
were much larger than any they had seen. There was one cliff
dwelling that was the largest of all. When he showed them how
large it was and how many rooms it contained they were quite
sure he could not be believed. No cliff dwelling could be so
large.</p>
<p>Acowitz persisted in his claims. Time after time he told
the Wetherills of the ruin that was the largest in the Mesa Verde.
Dubious but interested, the boys began to watch the cliffs whenever
their search for cattle took them into new canyons.</p>
<p>At last Al Wetherill thought he saw it.</p>
<p>He was following the bottom of a canyon in which none of
the boys had ever been. Far above, in the highest cliff, he saw
the arched roof of an enormous cave. Through the tops of the
trees Al thought he saw houses; he could not be sure. Anxious
to reach camp before darkness came he did not climb up to investigate.
The boys began to consider the claims of Acowitz
with less doubt. The cave seemed to exist; perhaps it did contain
the largest cliff dwelling of all.</p>
<p>The following winter two of the Wetherill brothers, Richard
and Alfred, and their brother-in-law, Charlie Mason, were
again in the Mesa Verde with their cattle. Day after day they
watched them, often riding the high mesa trails in search of
strays. As they rode they remembered the story of Acowitz
and the cave Al had seen. Before the winter was over they intended
to find it.</p>
<p>One snowy December day in 1888, Richard Wetherill and
Charlie Mason rode their horses up out of the Mancos Canyon
and began to follow the trail of some stray cattle northward
across the mesa top. Snow lay deep on the ground. Soft flakes
filled the air. Silently the two forced their way through the
heavy growth of pinon and juniper trees. Only the thud of the
horses&rsquo; feet and the creak of saddle leather broke the silence.
Near the edge of a canyon the growth thinned out and they finally
rode out into the open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie, look at that!&rdquo; cried Richard, pointing across the
canyon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>In the opposite wall was a tremendous cave. Filling it from
one end to the other, and rising even to its vaulted roof, was a
silent city of stone. No snow fell on the ancient city. No storm
had touched it through all the centuries. It seemed as eternal
as the ageless cliff that protected it.</p>
<p>Framed by the magnificent cave, a thin veil of snowflakes
drawn across its face, the silent city cast a spell over the two
cowboys. In all that vast wilderness there was no sound but
the soft hiss of the snowflakes and the throbbing of the boys&rsquo;
hearts. Speechless, they sat in their saddles.</p>
<p>At last one of the horses stirred and the spell was broken.</p>
<p>As the first flush of discovery passed, the two boys began
to search for a way to enter the ruin. Riding around the heads
of two small canyons they were soon above their goal. An ancient
trail led down the cliff. Breathless with excitement, they
walked into the cave and, as Charles Mason later recounted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We spent several hours going from room to room, and
picked up several articles of interest, among them a stone axe
with the handle still on it. There were also parts of several
human skeletons scattered about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again the great cliff dwelling knew the touch of man.
Six centuries after the despairing Indians deserted their home,
two flushed, happy men walked into it. A new era had dawned,
one that would see strange happenings in the Mesa Verde.</p>
<p>Excitedly the two cowboys scrambled about the ruin, prying
into every corner, appraising the many strange things they
found. Acowitz had been right; it was tremendous. They could
never hope to find another ruin as large. Throughout its entire
length the cave was full of houses; simple stone rooms
with small, high doorways and few windows. Here and there
among the houses were mysterious circular, subterranean
rooms that the boys could not understand. At the south end of
the cave was a four-story structure that touched the cave roof;
in the third-story room was a beautiful painting in red and
white. At the north end a terraced structure also rose to the
cave roof; in it was some of the best masonry in the entire
cave. On an upper ledge at the back of the cave was a long row
of smaller rooms. In them the boys found corn cobs, tassels
and shucks. Under flat rocks, where rats had not found them,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
were a few grains of corn and some brown beans. Instantly
the boys knew the ancient people had been farmers.</p>
<p>In the center of the cave was a graceful round tower. Every
stone in it was carefully rounded to fit the curve of the wall and
the entire tower tapered uniformly toward the top. In the tower
was the finest stone axe the boys ever found. But the use of the
tower puzzled them.</p>
<p>The ruin was in a sad state of repair. Roofs had fallen;
walls had partially crumbled. Courts and passageways were
choked with fallen stones, adobe mortar and broken roof beams.
Rat nests filled the darker corners and a mantle of dust and
cobwebs lay over all. Out of this jumble the once-proud city
raised an unbowed head. Only minor parts had fallen. The
greater part of it remained as the Indians had left it. The
crumbled parts spoke of age and the forces of decay; the unbroken
walls gave mute evidence of the skill of a vanished
people.</p>
<p>In order to see the great ruin as it was on the day of discovery
we must go again to Charles Mason&rsquo;s description, published
in the Denver Post in 1917, for, because of its condition,
he developed a strange theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The final tragedy of the cliff dwellers probably occurred
at Cliff Palace. There is scarcely room to doubt that the place
withstood an extended siege. In the entire building only two
timbers were found by us. All of the joists on which floors
and roofs were laid had been wrenched out. These timbers
are built into the walls and are difficult to remove, even the
little willows on which the mud roofs and upper floors are laid
were carefully taken out. No plausible reason for this has been
advanced except that it was used as fuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another strange circumstance is that so many of their
valuable possessions were left in the rooms and covered with
the clay of which the roofs and upper floors were made, not to
mention many of the walls broken down in tearing out the timbers.
It would seem that the intention was to conceal their
valuables, so their enemies might not secure them, or perhaps
the people were in such despair that property was not considered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;There were many human bones scattered about, as though
several people had been killed and left unburied. Had Cliff
Palace been abandoned, as has been suggested, and the timbers
used in other buildings, all movable articles of value would
have been taken away, instead of being covered and much of it
broken and destroyed unnecessarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that there can be no doubt that the Cliff
Dwellers were exterminated by their more savage and warlike
neighbors, the men being killed and the women being adopted
into the tribe of the conquerors, though in some cases migrations
may have become necessary as a result of drouth or pressure
from outside tribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While it would be difficult to prove Charles Mason&rsquo;s theory
that &ldquo;The final tragedy of the cliff dwellers probably occurred
at Cliff Palace,&rdquo; some of his other ideas were sound. The results
of many years of intensive research by leading scientists
show that he did a shrewd bit of forecasting when he suggested
that &ldquo;migrations may have become necessary as a result of
drouth or pressure from outside tribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After exploring Cliff Palace for several hours, the two cowboys,
flushed with excitement over their discovery, decided to
search for more ruins. Climbing out of the great cave, they
mounted their horses and, in order to cover more territory,
separated. Mason rode off to the north, while Wetherill went
to the north and west. Mason&rsquo;s search was fruitless but to
Richard Wetherill goes credit for the second discovery of the
day. After a short ride he came to a small canyon and, seeing
no ruins along its western wall, rode around the head of the
canyon and turned back to examine the eastern cliffs.</p>
<p>Immediately the discovery came. Within a hundred yards
of the head of the canyon was a long, low cave and in it was
another great cliff dwelling. While not as large as Cliff Palace,
it was in a better state of preservation. This ruin, later named
Spruce Tree House, has since proved to be the best-preserved
large cliff dwelling in the Mesa Verde.</p>
<p>Night was approaching so Richard made no attempt to enter
the ruin. Turning back, he met Mason at a prearranged spot
near Cliff Palace and they camped for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The following morning the two men set off to explore the
ruin Richard had seen. Misjudging their direction, they turned
too far to the west and within a short time found themselves on
the rim of one of the deepest canyons of the Mesa Verde. The
ruin for which they had been searching had eluded them but instead
of being disappointed, the two men were elated. At the
foot of the cliff, almost under their feet, was a third great cliff
dwelling.</p>
<p>This ruin was not as large as the two they had found the day
before but it was much larger than any they had seen previously.
In the center of the cliff dwelling was a tower, the tallest in
the Mesa Verde, and because of this outstanding structure, the
cowboys named the ruin Square Tower House.</p>
<p>For a time the two men sat on their horses, looking down
on the ruin and discussing their discoveries. During the past
few years they had seen many small cliff dwellings in the Mancos
Canyon and in other canyons to the south. Now they had
moved to the north and in two days had discovered three cliff
dwellings that dwarfed all the others. Off to the north and west
they could see still more canyons and they felt quite sure that
countless ruins were yet to be found. The importance of their
discoveries was all too apparent, so without pausing to search
for more ruins, or for the cattle they had originally sought,
they hurried back to the town of Mancos and spread the news
of what they had found.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of the amazing discoveries, John Wetherill
decided to investigate for himself. With three companions he
made his way to Cliff Palace. Near the south end of the ruin,
just back of the painted tower, one of the subterranean rooms
was in perfect condition except that the roof was missing. After
cleaning it out carefully, the boys stretched a canvas over it
and the room served as their home for a month.</p>
<p>It was a strange use for the ancient room. Six hundred years
earlier it had been a sacred ceremonial room, a kiva, where
reverent priests had conducted their ceremonies. Now it was
merely a living place for men of a different race. The cowboys
built their fire in the same firepit where the priests had built
theirs centuries earlier. They stored their food and possessions
on the same ledges where the priests had kept their
ceremonial things. They slept on the floor, exactly where the
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
tired priests had slept during their long ceremonies. The boys
had no knowledge that they were profaning a place of worship.
It was not until many years later that they learned they had
lived in a kiva, one of the ceremonial rooms of the ancient
people.</p>
<p>During the month they spent in the ruin John Wetherill and
his three friends searched endlessly for the things they knew
were buried under the debris. In the houses, under the dust
and fallen roofs, they found the utensils and tools the women
had once used. In the kivas they found the ceremonial paraphernalia
and tools of the men. Everywhere were the objects
that had been used in the daily life of the people. It became
evident that the ancient people had deserted their homes, leaving
in them the things they were unable to carry. Perhaps they
had intended to return and had left most of their possessions
behind.</p>
<p>Far back in the cave where there were no buildings the most
exciting discovery was made. In this part of the cave the roof
was too low for houses so the inhabitants had used it for a trash
room and as a roost for their flocks of domesticated turkeys.</p>
<p>As the cowboys dug through the accumulated trash they suddenly
found themselves face-to-face with the ancient Indians.
For some strange reason fourteen bodies had been buried there
in the trash. Natural processes had mummified them so perfectly
that in some the normal expression of the faces seemed
to be preserved. It was a thrilling discovery for there, except
for two things, were the Indians. In only two ways did the mummies
differ from the cowboys themselves. Only the moisture
and the spark of life were missing. If they could have restored
those two things the men would have found themselves confronted
with the actual builders of the cliff dwelling they were exploring.</p>
<p>Centuries earlier sorrowing relatives had buried them there
in the back of the cave. The dry earth and trash drew the
moisture from the flesh and, finally, only bones and dried tissues
remained. Nothing was missing except the spark of life
and the moisture. Everything else was in place; the bones,
flesh, skin, eyes, internal organs; all were there, only very,
very dry. Long hair still hung about the shoulders of the mummies
and in it were the mummies of ancient lice which had once
formed a happy population.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>John Wetherill found fourteen mummies in Cliff Palace. It
was a fitting climax to his first venture in archeology. Of the
five Wetherill brothers, John was the one who developed the
greatest interest in the ancient cultures. For many years after
his first work in Cliff Palace he was actively engaged in exploring
the Mesa Verde and nearby regions and making their
features known to the world.</p>
<p>It was a strange month the four cowboys spent in Cliff Palace
in that winter of 1888-89. In the midst of a silent snow-covered
wilderness they lived in and explored an ancient city
that was unknown to the civilized world. Centuries earlier it
had sheltered the Indians. Now it sheltered the newcomers.
Untouched by wind and snow they pried into the secrets of the
ancient people.</p>
<p>Within a short time after discovery the great ruin received
its name. Some of the early writers gave Richard Wetherill
credit for christening it but in later years John Wetherill gave
the credit to Charles Mason. In all probability we shall never
know who deserves the credit but we may feel sure the name
indicates the feelings those early explorers had about the
greatest of all cliff dwellings.</p>
<p>Cliff Palace was the name they gave it, an inspiring name
for the greatest structure the Mesa Verde people ever built.
It is not especially appropriate for the great ruin was never a
palace. Instead, it was a small city, the dwelling place of hundreds
of people. But the name was the choice of the men who
first explored it and it reflects their feelings toward the ancient
structure.</p>
<p>Now we must pause for a moment. The story of the discovery
of the cliff dwellings would not be complete if we were
to go further without admitting that there are some uncertainties.
Many years after the events we have just witnessed were
a matter of record, other men came forward with claims that
they had seen Cliff Palace before 1888. Even the various
Wetherill brothers did not agree entirely in their stories about
the discovery of the ruins. As a result, there is a certain
amount of confusion concerning the events of those early days.</p>
<p>But the two events we have just witnessed can be accepted
without the slightest doubt. Jackson was in Two-Story Cliff
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
House in 1874, and Charles Mason and Richard Wetherill were in
Cliff Palace in 1888. No one has ever questioned the claims of
these men.</p>
<p>Jackson was travelling with a scientific party sent out by the
government. He photographed Two-Story Cliff House and other
small cliff dwellings in the Mancos Canyon and in the following
year published the pictures and descriptions of the ruins in a
scientific report. So to Jackson goes credit for the discovery of
the first small cliff dwellings of the Mesa Verde. If John Moss,
who was Jackson&rsquo;s guide, or other early explorers were in the
ruins before 1874, no record has come down to us.</p>
<p>It is equally certain that Charles Mason and Richard Wetherill
were in Cliff Palace in 1888, for they announced their discovery
immediately. The account which has been given here has
come directly from written records left by Charles Mason and
John Wetherill, and from personal interviews with the two men.</p>
<p>In 1935, Mason visited the Mesa Verde for the last time.
In spite of his 74 years he was active and alert and the events
of the early days were clear in his mind. We drove along the
canyon rims and without hesitation he pointed out the cliff from
which he and Richard Wetherill had first seen Cliff Palace.
For an hour we sat in the sun as he recalled the events of that
day, December 18, 1888, when he and Richard had sat there on
their horses, gazing in amazement at the great ruin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had heard of Cliff Palace before we saw it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;A Ute Indian, named Acowitz, had told us about it and we had
always hoped to find it. The Utes were afraid of the ruins because
of the spirits of the old people that they believed were in
them. If we wanted to keep the Utes out of our camp we just
put a skull up on a stick and they wouldn&rsquo;t come near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remembering the problems they had with their cattle, he
added, &ldquo;Hunting cattle in those days was no easy job. They were
as wild as deer and the country was rough. Once we spent a week
chasing them and all we got back to town was an old cow and her
calf. We shot lots of them like deer and packed the meat out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1932, John Wetherill visited the Mesa Verde. As we
strolled through Cliff Palace he told of the month he and his
three friends had spent there in 1888-89. He pointed out the
kiva where they had lived, the spot where the beautiful stone
axe had been found and the place where they had discovered the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
fourteen mummies. He recalled that all of the roofs had been
torn out, just as Charles Mason said, and he remembered that
they had found more baskets in Cliff Palace than in any other
cliff dwelling.</p>
<p>Then, pointing across the canyon, he said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where
Richard and Charley were when they first saw Cliff Palace.&rdquo;
The bold cliff at which he pointed is called Sun Point today, and
it was from this same point that Mason said he and Richard
Wetherill first saw Cliff Palace.</p>
<p>It is quite true that other men have claimed they were in
Cliff Palace before 1888. Not a shred of documentary evidence
has been found to support these claims, however, so credit for
being the first modern men to enter the greatest of all cliff
dwellings goes to Charles Mason and Richard Wetherill.</p>
<p>During the years that followed the discovery of Cliff
Palace, the Wetherills and other men discovered hundreds of
cliff dwellings in the canyons of the Mesa Verde. They found,
also, that the mesa tops were dotted with additional hundreds
of ruins. As a result of these discoveries the fame of the
Mesa Verde spread and within a short time many men were
digging in the ruins.</p>
<p>The period following 1888 is the sad chapter in the history
of the Mesa Verde. From the very beginning it was apparent
that digging in the ruins was a profitable business. The
Wetherills sold their first collection for $3000 and the word
spread that artifacts from the ruins had actual cash value.
Charles Mason indicated this only too well in his article published
in the Denver Post on July 1, 1917. The article was
signed by four of the Wetherills and without doubt gives a fairly
accurate picture of what happened in the Mesa Verde following
the discovery of the ruins.</p>
<p>In referring to their second expedition Mason wrote, &ldquo;This
time we went at it in a more business-like manner. Our previous
work had been carried out more to satisfy our own curiosity
than for any other purpose but this time it was a business
proposition.&rdquo; And in referring to a still later expedition Mason
stated, &ldquo;In spite of the fact that all of the cliff dwellings had
been worked over two or three times, we succeeded in making
a very good showing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The Wetherills themselves took a number of collections of
artifacts from the cliff dwellings. Most of these collections
are now in museums and since the Wetherills kept notes on
their findings the material has real scientific value. In 1891,
Baron Gustav Nordenskiold, a young Swedish archeologist, excavated
in a score of the cliff dwellings and took a splendid
collection back to his homeland. Soon after his return home
Nordenskiold died and the collection was sold to a museum in
Finland, where it rests uneasily today. In addition to the
Wetherills and Nordenskiold, many other men worked in the
ruins and they probably carried away an equal amount of material.</p>
<p>As a result of all this early work the ruins were well cleaned
out before the area was made a national park. A number of
cliff dwellings have been excavated by archeologists in recent
times and little material of any importance has been found in
them.</p>
<p>Even though the Mesa Verde could only be reached by a
thirty mile horseback trip, it was visited by a surprising number
of people in those early years. Some came only to see the
ruins but many came to dig and on the return trip the packs
often bulged with things taken from the ruins. Priceless artifacts
which had so long been unmolested were thoughtlessly
carried away.</p>
<p>As a result of these visits, however, the fame of the Mesa
Verde grew and finally public sentiment came to its aid. Gradually
there developed a realization that the ruins should be
preserved for all time and made accessible to all people.</p>
<p>The first effort toward this appears to have been made in
1886, even before the discovery of Cliff Palace and the other
large cliff dwellings. In that year a group of Denver people
called attention to the need for a national park to preserve the
ruins of the Mesa Verde. Five years later the Colorado General
Assembly addressed a memorial to the Congress and in
1894, two petitions were sent to the Congress urging that a part
of the Mesa Verde be preserved as a national park.</p>
<p>As the years passed, the agitation continued but little was
accomplished. In 1897, however, the attention of the Colorado
Federation of Women&rsquo;s Clubs was directed to the problem and
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
a committee of fourteen women was appointed to spearhead the
fight. Three years later the committee was expanded into the
Colorado Cliff Dwellings Association, an incorporated organization
dedicated to the struggle for the preservation of the ruins.</p>
<p>With grim determination the women worked, both with officials
in Washington and the Ute Indians whose reservation included
the Mesa Verde. After years of disappointments their
efforts were crowned with success for on June 29, 1906, the
Congress passed a bill creating Mesa Verde National Park.</p>
<p>At last, after six hundred empty years, the cliff dwellings
were again in the care of men who were interested in their
well-being. These men were of a different race and their feelings
toward the cliff dwellings were far different from those of
the people who had built them. To the ancient people the cave
structures had meant home and security. To the new caretakers
they were a milestone in the story of mankind and as
such they should be preserved for all time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">3</span>
<br />LIFE IN ANCIENT TIMES</h2>
<p>In a little while we are going to do a very strange thing.</p>
<p>We are, first of all, going to go back seven centuries to the
year 1268 A.D. Then we will climb down the trail and stroll
into Cliff Palace. Somewhere near the center of the town we
will find a comfortable seat on the roof of one of the houses.
And for a year we will sit there, quietly and comfortably, watching
the people. We will take no part in the activities&mdash;we will
simply watch the inhabitants of the town as, through the year,
they go their daily rounds.</p>
<p>There is no better way to understand what life was like in
a cliff dwelling. The ancient structures themselves do not tell
the whole story, nor do the artifacts in the museum. The well-built
walls and the skillfully made artifacts are ample evidence
of the abilities of the people but these articles of stone, bone
and wood do not tell us all we would like to know.</p>
<p>The real story is in the people and if we are to understand
it, we must see them with our own eyes. So, after setting the
scene, we will go back to Cliff Palace in the year 1268 A.D., and
take our seats. And when the year has passed, we will understand
what life was like in the Mesa Verde when the cliff dwellings
were alive.</p>
<p>We shall select Cliff Palace for our experiment because it
was the largest of the cliff dwellings: certainly it was the crowning
achievement of the Mesa Verde people. To modern man it
may seem only a village but to the Indians it was much more than
that. Located almost in the center of the great mesa was the
largest cave of all. In it was the greatest structure they ever built.</p>
<p>To the people it was the big town, the hub of their small
world. In their eyes it was magnified by comparison with the
hundreds of smaller cliff dwellings around it. To them it was
a city, the greatest they ever knew. Certainly there could be
no better place for us to see the life of those eventful days
when thousands of people lived in the Mesa Verde.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Before we take up actual residence in Cliff Palace we should
answer one question, a question that is asked very often. How
can we know what was happening in a town that was abandoned
almost seven hundred years ago? The former inhabitants have
disappeared and they left no written records. How will we be
able to see the intimate details in the lives of those people?</p>
<p>It is a good question. It is often in the minds of visitors as
they walk through the silent city and listen to the stories that
are told about the former inhabitants. Intimate details in the
lives of the people are laid bare. Assertions are made for
which there is no visible evidence. The visitor can scarcely
be blamed for wearing a skeptical look in his eyes.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of the intimacies of the ancient life has come
from a number of sources. Through intensive study, archeologists,
ethnologists and historians have worked out the details
that go toward making a complete story. From countless sources
they have garnered the bits of information that fit together in
jig-saw fashion to give us a picture of life in a cliff dwelling.
Unfortunately, some pieces of the picture are still missing;
here and there are rather large and distressing holes. In some
lines of research, blank walls have been encountered and mystery
still enshrouds some of the phases we would like most of
all to see.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, the picture is rather complete. By
fitting together all of the bits of knowledge that have been given
to us by various scientists we can see very well the happenings
in one of the ancient villages.</p>
<p>The archeologist has given us the general background of the
people of Cliff Palace. Decades of research have revealed the
development of the Pueblo Indians during their one thousand
year occupation of the Mesa Verde. But the archeologist has
gone even farther and, in a general way, has traced the people
back through countless centuries to their original home in a
far continent. We shall see this long story of development in
later chapters.</p>
<p>Originally the people came from Asia, drifting into America
across the Bering Sea. From Alaska they drifted south and,
after endless generations, reached the Southwest. Up to this
time they had lived as roving hunters but somewhere in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Southwest they met other Indians who were farmers. This new
life appealed to them and, borrowing the precious seeds, they
gradually became a farming people.</p>
<p>At about the time of Christ they moved into the Mesa Verde
region and soon some of them were living on the Mesa Verde
itself. At first their culture was simple but for a thousand years
it developed. Finally it reached its peak in the thirteenth century
when Cliff Palace and the other cliff dwellings were built.</p>
<p>In addition to giving us the background, the archeologists
have given us the material details of the ancient city. Through
their excavations the actual remains have been brought to light,
studied and interpreted. When we walk through Cliff Palace we
appreciate the tremendous overhanging cave roof that protected
the entire city. We see the results of the physical labors of
the people; the houses with their smooth walls and bright paintings,
the storage rooms, kivas, open courts, narrow winding
passageways, firepits, and in the back of the cave, the trash
room where the turkeys roosted.</p>
<p>In the nearby museum we see the actual physical remains,
the skeletons and mummies, of the people themselves. We see
their clothing and their jewelry. There also are the utensils
and tools; pottery, basketry, bows and arrows, stone knives,
bone awls and needles, grinding stones, fire drills, planting
sticks, stone axes and mauls; an endless array of things that
were once in common use.</p>
<p>All of this has been given to us by the archeologist. He has
shown us the long background of the people and has unearthed,
restored and interpreted the actual material things from the
ruin. To many people these things seem cold and inanimate.
They seem dead; just stone, bone, wood and clay. There is life
in them, though, for they are the expressions of the desires,
ambitions, loves and hates of the people. Every single article
was produced because of some human desire or need.</p>
<p>The person who keeps this in mind is able to walk through
Cliff Palace, even today, and see the former inhabitants, for in
the results of their efforts they still live. Many visitors forget
this and do not see the people. Even the archeologist often fails
to see them as he is a scientist who deals only with realities.
Sometimes he can not see the people for the walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Historians have also contributed to the story of ancient Indian
life. The musty records of the early explorers of the
Southwest contain many extremely valuable observations concerning
the Pueblo Indians. These the historians have ferreted
out.</p>
<p>As early as 1540, the Spaniards began to enter the Pueblo
country when Coronado traversed almost the entire area. Other
Spanish explorers followed Coronado. Missions were established
in many of the pueblos and for three centuries the Spaniards
were in close contact with the Indians. Later the American
explorers entered the Southwest and they, too, came in contact
with the Indians. The chronicles of these explorers, both Spanish
and American, contain many passages concerning the life
and customs of the Pueblo people. Many of these early records
have been translated and compiled and from them we gain knowledge
of Pueblo life during the last four centuries. It is true
that not all of the observations were accurate. Many were
spiced with prejudice and deliberate fallacy but still they have
been of value.</p>
<p>The Spaniards came into the Southwest less than three centuries
after the Pueblo Indians left the Mesa Verde and drifted
to the South. The Indians were still living in terraced pueblos.
They were still farmers; corn, beans and squash still dominated
the food bowl out of which each family ate. In a material
way they had changed little, so it is safe to assume they had
changed little in their social and religious customs.</p>
<p>Even after the white men arrived there was little change in
the life of the Pueblo Indians until within the last few decades.
For that reason the early records, when properly interpreted,
add much to our knowledge of the ancient cultures.</p>
<p>Ethnologists have done a vast amount of work that supplements
the labors of the archeologist and the historian. The
ethnologist is a scientist who makes an actual detailed study of
a group of living Indians. Every cultural detail is recorded
and there have been ethnologists who knew almost as much
about the Indians whom they studied as the Indians knew about
themselves.</p>
<p>Some of the ethnologists have lived in the pueblos for long
periods of time. In some cases they have been accepted by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
Indians and have even been taken into the priesthood. An outstanding
example was Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing, an ethnologist
who lived in the pueblo of Zuni from 1879 to 1884. He
learned the Zuni language, was adopted into the Macaw clan and
was initiated into various religious societies. He participated
in the religious ceremonies, wore native costume, ate native
foods and took part in the various occupations and pastimes.
Before he left the pueblo he became the second chief of the
tribe and was made the head priest of the Bow, one of the highest
religious offices.</p>
<p>Such men as Cushing have given us detailed knowledge of
the legends, religion, ceremonies, social customs and daily life
of the modern Pueblo Indians. Since these Indians are descendants
of the ancient Pueblo Indians, this knowledge has enabled
us to answer many questions.</p>
<p>The person who walks into Cliff Palace and views a kiva for
the first time has not the slightest chance of guessing its original
purpose. It is absolutely remote from anything he has ever
seen. But when he is told that these same strange rooms still
survive in the present-day pueblos and are used as club rooms
and ceremonial chambers, the use becomes immediately apparent.
In the center of the ancient kiva floor is a tiny hole that
has no obvious purpose. That same hole is still found in some
of the present-day kivas and the Indian explains that it is the
spirit entrance to the earth. Even the wisest archeologist could
never have guessed that.</p>
<p>Without the help of present-day Indians it would be almost
impossible to answer questions about such non-material things
as religion and social customs. We can dig up the bones of a
man, every bone he ever possessed. But who can look at those
bones and tell how many wives he had? Some people think it
should show but it doesn&rsquo;t. In order to answer the question we
simply go to the descendants of that man. Without doubt they
still have the same customs.</p>
<p>From all this it can be seen that the ethnologist has added
much to our story. Since the Pueblo Indians of today are the
descendants of the Pueblo Indians of a few centuries ago, a
thorough knowledge of them is the soundest approach to an understanding
of the ancient people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>In using our knowledge of the modern Pueblo Indians in an
effort to picture life in ancient times we are faced with an important
question. How much have the customs changed because
of the influence of the Spaniards?</p>
<p>As soon as the Spaniards entered the Pueblo country they
established missions in the Indian pueblos. The native religion
was suppressed and a new religion was forced upon the Pueblo
people. In the Rio Grande area in New Mexico this foreign
pressure was strongest and there can be little doubt that the
native Indian religion and customs have changed to some extent.
In the western pueblos of the Zunis and Hopis the Spanish
pressure was not so great. Missions were maintained at Zuni
only intermittently and among the Hopis for only a short time.
As a result the native Pueblo religion and customs of these
western pueblos have undergone less change and they will be
used, for the most part, in our effort to picture the ancient life
of the Mesa Verde.</p>
<p>As we move into Cliff Palace to spend a year with the inhabitants
we must not forget the sources of our knowledge. First,
we have the cultural background of the people, their rise from
roving hunters to stable agriculturists; second, we have the
great ruin itself and the things the people left in it; third, we
have the interpretations of Indians who are descendants of the
ancient people. All these will be added together to complete
the picture. We must realize, however, that there are questions
still unanswered: some problems will never satisfactorily be
solved. But if we use the knowledge that has been gained and
remain within the realm of plausibility we shall be able to follow
the people very well as they go through their daily lives.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to turn back the centuries. We are ready
to walk into Cliff Palace and live with the people. How better
can we see the life of the ancient city? We will follow the men,
women and children, as they go through the daily round of life.
Spring, summer, autumn and winter will pass. We will see the
work, the play, the dreams, the desires, the happiness and the
bitter disappointments in the lives of the people. We will take
no part in the activities. We will merely watch.</p>
<p>What year shall it be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="568" />
<p class="pcap">Seven centuries ago Cliff Palace was a busy, happy city of about four hundred people</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>It makes no difference as long as it is a good year, a normal
year, with an abundance of snow and rain. That was the most
important factor because of its effect upon the harvests. Tree
ring records show that 1261 and 1262 were normal years, also
1265, 1266, 1267, 1268, 1269, 1271 and 1272. All of those were
good years and that was the time when Cliff Palace was at its
height. The people had been living in the cave for many years
and the great city was surely at its peak.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the year 1268. It is as good as any. It was a
normal, happy year for the people of Cliff Palace.</p>
<p>Let the centuries roll back&mdash;it is 1268 A.D.</p>
<p>As we walk into Cliff Palace we find it at the very peak of
its development. For generations it has been growing until now
it fills the great sheltering cave. There are over two hundred
one-room houses in the city; they fill the cave from end to end
and rise in terraces to a height of three and even four stories.
At the south end and again at the north end the terraced structures
rise to touch the cave roof.</p>
<p>Scattered about the city are twenty-three kivas, the underground
ceremonial chambers. Their flat roofs serve as courts
where many of the activities take place. The roofs of the terraced
houses are also the scene of much activity and throughout
the city many ladders lean against the walls, leading from one
level to the next.</p>
<p>To us Cliff Palace seems like a great two-hundred-room
apartment house. To the occupants it is a city of two hundred
houses, occupied by scores of families. Over four hundred
people live in the city; they swarm about the courts and over
the roofs like so many busy brown ants.</p>
<p>As we enter the city we notice immediately the appearance
of the people. They are typical Indians. They seem rather
short, the men averaging about five feet four inches in height
and the women about five feet. They are heavy-set and as we
watch them we get the impression that as a rule they are a
short, stocky people. The skin color varies from light to dark
brown; some of them are so dark they seem almost black. The
eyes are also brown and the hair varies from dark brown to a
deep lustrous black.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The people have broad heads and the back of each head is
flattened, a deformity caused in infancy by a hard cradle board.
The faces are broad and the cheek bones are prominent. Occasionally
we notice &ldquo;slanting&rdquo; Mongoloid eyes. The people
seem to have certain Mongoloid tendencies although they are
not a pure Mongoloid type.</p>
<p>This town where we are going to spend the year is simply a
large terraced apartment house built in a great cave. In the
two hundred or more rooms live at least four hundred Indians,
short, stocky, brown-skinned people whom we will know well
before the year is over.</p>
<p>The centuries have rolled back to the year 1268 A.D., and
we take our seats on a roof.</p>
<p>It is spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>

<br />SPRING</h2>
<p>Spring is a happy, joyous time for the people of Cliff Palace
and there is much laughter and gaiety in the great cave. The
bleak, uncomfortable winter is over; there is a feeling of freedom
and broken bonds. Everything in nature indicates that a
new year and new life are beginning and the people respond just
as do the animals and plants.</p>
<p>The winter that is ending has been cold and even though the
people became accustomed to it there was suffering and sadness.
Many of the older people who were afflicted with rheumatism
and arthritis suffered terribly and the children developed
colds and other diseases against which the medicine men were
powerless. Several deaths occurred in Cliff Palace last winter
and there was sadness and fear in the cave city. These misfortunes
were caused by witches, who are evil human beings
with only one desire&mdash;to injure and destroy the people. Winter
is the season when witches are most active so it is a time of
fear and dread for the inhabitants of the town.</p>
<p>Now spring is here and the people are gay and lighthearted.
Spring is ever a happy time for farmers for the miracle of new
life never loses its thrill. Spring, the season of new life; summer,
the season of growth and development; autumn, the season
of ripening and harvest; winter, the season of suffering, death
and sorrow. Then spring comes again and the eternal cycle
has another joyous beginning.</p>
<p>In March the sun begins to be warm. During the morning,
while still in the shadow, the cave is cold but in the afternoon
when the sun creeps in, it is very pleasant. Some days the sun
is actually hot as it beats into the sheltered cave. Chipmunks
and squirrels, even the lizards, come out of hibernation to sun
themselves on the warm rocks. The Indians do likewise.</p>
<p>As the sun begins to climb into the cave each afternoon the
people come out to meet it. Uncomfortable winter clothing is
thrown aside and soon most of the inhabitants of the cave are
sunning themselves on the front terraces. Everyone is happy.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
There is much laughter and boisterous shouting. The aged men
and women bring their rheumatic bones out into the warm sunlight
and immediately feel new life. Gaunt old men, whose
creaking joints have not climbed the cliff trails for years, get
a new gleam in their eyes as they vow they will raise a crop of
corn this summer. Aged women begin to twist their gnarled
fingers as they dream of making pottery again.</p>
<p>The able-bodied men sit in small groups, dreaming and talking
of the planting time that is coming. Wrinkled old priests
assure them that it will be a fine season. All signs are right;
the gods are smiling on their people. The women think of new
pottery they must make, repairs they plan for their houses,
and marriages they must arrange for their daughters. Young
wives, in whom romance has not been dulled by too many children,
playfully comb the lice from their husbands&rsquo; heads and
dream of babies soon to come. Spring is a fine time for that.</p>
<p>Here and there young unmarried men lean against the walls,
presumably dozing in the sun. But they are the busiest of all.
Each one is endeavoring to catch the eye of some dusky young
maiden whose full-rounded curves are causing her mother to
think of a son-in-law. The young man&rsquo;s eyes seldom connect;
the ever vigilant eyes of mothers and aunts come between.</p>
<p>The really active members of the populace are the children.
Some play on the trash pile in front of the cave; others scramble
over the boulders that litter the slope below. Their rich
brown skins flash in the sun as they endeavor to make up in one
afternoon for all of the cold inactivity of the winter. Their
shouts and laughter are mingled with the barking of their dogs
and the gobbling of the turkeys they are disturbing. During the
winter the turkeys stayed close to the cave but now they are
scattered over the slope, nipping off the early buds and searching
for the first insects of spring.</p>
<p>Not every March day is warm: some are blustery with the
changeable weather of spring. A clear blue sky turns black in
only a few minutes and heavy wet snow swirls into the canyons.
The snow soon changes to rain, then a cool breeze swings down
from the north and the rain becomes icy pellets of sleet. In a
few minutes the clouds blow away and the warm sun shines again
on a dripping, steaming world. Sometimes during the night,
warm, wet snow falls, snow so heavy that its weight snaps limbs
from the trees. The warm rocks and the bright sun melt it
rapidly and often there is a roaring waterfall over the front of
Cliff Palace cave as the water rushes off the mesa top.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The weather grows steadily warmer and winter is left behind.
There is much activity in the city. Everyone is up at
sunrise and the work of the day is immediately started. After
several hours of work, breakfast is eaten late in the morning,
then the activities are resumed. The second and last meal of
the day, an early supper, brings an end to the day&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>During the winter the cave became damp and musty; everything
needs to be aired out. Clothing, blankets, robes and floor
mats are spread out on the terraces and roofs to bake in the
sun. The women tie small bunches of stiff grass with cords and
with these brush-like brooms sweep the houses and courtyards
thoroughly. Trash is swept into the back of the cave where the
turkeys roost or out on the ever-growing trash pile which slides
far down the slope in front.</p>
<p>Even the kivas, the underground ceremonial rooms, are
cleaned and the walls are replastered to hide the soot that has
accumulated. The men do some of the cleaning but women are
often invited to help, especially with the plastering. It is considered
a great honor for a woman to be chosen to plaster a
kiva.</p>
<p>A major part of the spring work is the repairing of houses.
It is work that never seems to end for repairs and alterations
are always in progress in some part of the city except in the
winter when it is too cold. Spring is the best time for the repair
work as there is an abundance of water for the mortar and
the home owners are filled with a desire to build and improve.
Cracks are merely filled with mud and small chinking stones.
Sometimes a small section of wall has bulged dangerously and
must be replaced. Often the walls have been built on a foundation
of loose trash and as a result, settle until they are in danger
of falling. Such walls, sometimes entire rooms, must be torn
down and rebuilt. Sometimes a house is deserted by its owners
for some reason and gradually goes to ruin. As it crumbles
the stones and the roof poles are used in the repairing or building
of other houses. It is an endless cycle, this building and
repairing of houses, and all stages of it can be seen in the town
almost any time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Most of the repair work is done by the women for the houses
belong to them. When there is heavy work, new poles to cut or
new stones to shape, the men help but even then the women
supervise.</p>
<p>Very often, as is true among all people, the women change
the decorations of their houses. A new whim stirs the housewife&rsquo;s
imagination and in an hour&rsquo;s time the entire scheme is
changed. The husband never knows what to expect when he returns
from a day in the fields. Decorations are easily applied
for they consist of thin layers of clay mud, spread on the walls
with the hands. Sometimes the entire house is smoothly plastered
with red, yellow, grey, brown or white clay. Other houses
are plastered only on the outside; some only on the inside.
Here is a house that is plastered half-way down from the ceiling;
next door is one that is plastered half-way up from the
floor.</p>
<p>Many of the walls are decorated with bright paintings. Red
ochre makes a rich red plaster, while up on the mesa top is a
layer of clay that gives a clean chalky-white color. When the
two are combined, the effect is striking. Most of the paintings
are small; the picture of an animal, a geometric design or
perhaps just a band of color across a wall. In the center of
Cliff Palace is a house that has a row of nine, bright red hands
painted above the door. The woman who lives there placed her
left hand on the wall and traced it nine times. Then she filled
in the outlines with red ochre to produce the odd decoration.</p>
<p>Near the south end of the town is the most beautifully decorated
house of all. It is the third-floor room of the great four-story
tower, the tallest structure in the cave. The young lady
who lives there is very artistic and all four inside walls are
beautifully painted in red and white. The lower half of the walls
she painted with red ochre. The upper half she covered with
the chalky-white clay. Where the two bands of color came together
she painted large red triangles in groups of three. Thus
the edge of the red border consists of three triangles, or peaks,
then a straight line, three more triangles, and so on around the
room. On the white upper portions of the walls are geometric
designs painted in red; parallel straight lines, parallel zigzag
lines and parallel fringed lines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The painting was cleverly done and the final effect is strikingly
beautiful. The young woman is artistic in everything she
does. Her pottery designs are the best in the city and she even
wears her little yucca-string skirt at an artistically rakish
angle. The men of the neighborhood often speak of her artistry.
Their wives speak of her extremely poor cooking.</p>
<p>As spring progresses the weather grows warmer. The
wet, heavy snows come less frequently and most of the days
are full of sunshine. Sometimes sharp winds sweep off the
snow-covered mountains to the north and cut across the mesa
tops but the sheltering cave keeps them out of Cliff Palace.</p>
<p>As April arrives the effects of sunshine and moisture become
evident. The grass is green, leaves are coming out on
the shrubs and the earth is broken by the first tender shoots of
myriads of growing plants. There is a damp, earthy smell in
the canyons; the dank odor of rotting leaf mold, the heavy odor
of wet clay. Through it all is the delicate fragrance of growing,
budding plants. Back from the south come the first birds and
spring is definitely in the Mesa Verde.</p>
<p>The earth-loving Indians are bursting with restless energy
and everyone is busy. Sometimes the town is almost deserted
as the call of spring draws them out of the cave. The cliffs
echo with the laughter of small children as they play along the
slopes and down in the bottom of the canyon. During the winter
in the shadowy cave their skins became pale but already the
spring sun is tanning them to a warm brown. Their hearts are
light; they are like unrestrained little brown animals as they
play the days away. They have fewer cares and troubles than
the chipmunks and squirrels whose lives they make miserable.
Each small boy carries a bow and each one knows how to set
cord snares in the runways among the rocks. Sometimes a
small hunter is successful and the cliffs ring with his exultant
shouts as he brings a chipmunk or a squirrel or even a fat rat
to his mother. At the next meal he is a hero and receives the
choicest morsels from his kill.</p>
<p>Some of the older boys go out on the mesas for larger game.
The wet, silent earth makes it easy for them to stalk the deer
and mountain sheep that have never been alarmed by the thundering
reports of firearms. At long range their flint-tipped
arrows are not effective but they are clever stalkers and at
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
close range the silent arrows are deadly. In the evening they
return with their game. They trot proudly down the precipitous
trails and through the city, hoping that the eyes of the maidens
will rest upon them. But the soft brown eyes are always turned
away&mdash;still they see.</p>
<p>Most of the men climb up to the mesa-top fields even though
they are too wet to be worked. Their love of the soil draws
them to their farms and they boast about the crops they intend
to grow, or listen to the old men as they tell of the miraculous
crops of bygone years.</p>
<p>Even though it is too early to farm, the men are soon busy.
New land must be cleared to replace fields that have been
farmed too long. The sagebrush and shrubs are pulled up or
are dug out of the ground with digging sticks. Small trees are
cut with stone axes but the larger trees are burned and in all
parts of the Mesa Verde columns of smoke rise as men of the
different villages clear the land. Usually this clearing of new
land is done in the late winter and early spring when the cool
damp weather makes it easier for the men to control the fires.
If the burning were done in the summer, forest fires would result
and vast areas would be rendered uninhabitable through
loss of fire wood and logs for house construction.</p>
<p>The fields are owned in common by the village but they are
allotted to the clans, which are groups of families related through
the female line. The clan in turn allots the fields to its various
households, or families. After a generation or two the lands
farmed by members of a household seem almost to belong to it
but the real control is by the clan. As long as a piece of land
is farmed properly it remains with the household but if it is
neglected or if the household dies out, the clan heads allot it to
other households within the clan. Since the clans are matrilineal,
with descent of property in the female line, a man farms
land belonging to his wife&rsquo;s clan.</p>
<p>In the early spring no one is busier than the women. Each
day they scour the canyons and mesas for early plants that will
lend variety to the diet. During the late winter the food became
monotonous. Day after day it was cornbread, beans and meat.
Principally it was cornbread and although it was prepared in a
number of ways it became tiresome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The early spring plants bring a welcome variation to this
restricted diet. The green shoots of beeweed and tansy mustard
and the first tender leaves of saltbush make delicious greens
when boiled with pieces of fat and a dash of salt. Wild onions
and juniper berries add an exciting flavor to a pot of deer meat
stew. The puff-ball, a spherical, fungus-like growth six or
eight inches in diameter, is sought eagerly after each warm
spring rain. Toasted slices of puff-ball, eaten with a sauce
made of salt and wild onions, are a real spring delicacy. Innumerable
plants are edible and by countless generations of
experimenting the Indian women have discovered their good
qualities. They know exactly how to use each plant and new
aromas rise from the cooking pots.</p>
<p>During the winter the people ate the monotonous food because
they needed the nourishment. Now they eat for the joy of
eating. Eyes gleam with anticipation as each family gathers
around the fire in the late afternoon while the mother prepares
the main meal of the day. There is cornbread, made in any
one of a dozen ways. Deer meat is being roasted or boiled, or
is bubbling in a thick stew. A pot of greens is stewing or a pot
of beans, flavored with some spring plant, boils on the fire. A
great pot of thin corn gruel, which will be drunk as a tea, simmers
on its bed of coals. At last the food is ready and the
steaming pots are placed on the ground in the midst of the
family group.</p>
<p>As soon as all is ready the man of the family selects a sample
of food from each pot; a few beans, a pinch of greens, a
small piece of meat, a bit of bread, a few drops of tea. These
he throws into the fire as an offering to the gods. Then the eating
begins.</p>
<p>The only tools are the fingers and they are plunged eagerly
into the food, hot though it may be. Chunks of meat are picked
out and if too hot are held on a piece of bread. Bones are
gnawed on, then dropped back into the pot as the fingers are
needed for something else. Dunking is common and the bread
is used to scoop up the thick stew. Toothless old men, becoming
impatient, pick up the bowls and drink over the edge. There
are long-handled ladles for dipping out the soup and broth, and
stein-like mugs for the tea.</p>
<p>During the meal there is little talking; the accent is on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
food. The only noise is the licking of fingers and the loud
smacking of lips that express appreciation for especially succulent
morsels. As the men settle back, swollen from overeating,
they seek relief in deep rumbling belches, each of which
is a pat on the back for the cook. No words are necessary for
a slow rumbling belch is far more expressive. It speaks of a
full, happy stomach, complete relaxation and sleepy contentment.
Each belch brings happiness to the fond wife and mother
and she smiles as she removes the empty pots from the midst
of her gorged and sleepy family.</p>
<p>Darkness is still an hour away but as the sun drops behind
the opposite canyon rim the chill of the spring evening creeps
into the cave. Women sit by the fires, robes around their
shoulders, and visit idly. The men and older boys go to their
kivas to talk, to doze, or perhaps to gamble a little. The children,
following the shouted directions of their mothers, gather
the turkeys which have been feeding on the trash pile in front of
the town and drive them into the rear of the cave where they
will be safe from prowling night animals.</p>
<p>As darkness falls the day&rsquo;s activities are ended and quiet
settles over the city. Mats, skins and blankets are rolled out
on the floors of the houses and soon the people of Cliff Palace
are asleep. The quiet of the night is broken only by the snoring
of tired men and the barking of a fox across the canyon. The
tiny sliver of a new moon sinks behind the western mesa leaving
brilliant, low-hung stars to watch over the sleeping people.</p>
<p>During the early spring one of the most important activities
of the women is the making of new pottery. Very little was
made during the winter because of the cold but much was broken.
Numb fingers often let the vessels slip and now each woman
needs to replenish her stock of water jars, cooking pots, bowls,
ladles and mugs. The greatest need is for the large water jars.
In the early summer there will be a long period of dry weather.
For at least a month, possibly for two months, there may not
be a drop of rain on the Mesa Verde. The springs will dwindle
and the great pools in the bottom of the canyon will shrink.
There must be additional stored water.</p>
<p>There are no wells or cisterns so water will be stored in
the large jars. The women must make many of them, each one
large enough to hold several gallons of water. During the late
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
spring rains they will be filled and set away in small storage
rooms that were emptied of their corn and beans during the
winter. When the dry weather comes the stored water will be
of vital importance.</p>
<p>The women of Cliff Palace make the beautiful black-on-white
pottery that is typical of all the people of the Mesa Verde. They
are proud of the graceful shapes and exact designs and each
woman strives to excel her neighbors. All of the women use
the same methods and there is a surprising sameness about
their products. Each one varies her designs and no two pieces
are exactly alike but all are of a standardized type. Each piece
proclaims its Mesa Verde origin.</p>
<p>The women are very proud of their pottery and seldom
swerve from the conventional type. Sometimes when the men
go to distant regions on trading trips they bring home a few
pieces of foreign pottery. Their wives compare this pottery
with their own and are always satisfied. They feel that their
wares excel all others and continue to make the same types
their mothers and grandmothers made.</p>
<p>Pottery making is a long, detailed process requiring much
skill and only after many years of practice are women able to
make pieces of the finest quality. Each step must be carefully
and thoroughly executed or the final result will not make a
woman&rsquo;s husband proud when he compares her pottery with that
of the other women.</p>
<p>Two ingredients are needed for the actual construction;
pottery clay and a tempering material. The clay occurs in a
shale layer at the foot of the upper cliff of the canyon wall.
There are many deposits, large and small, and each woman has
a favorite place from which she obtains her clay. Up the canyon
from Cliff Palace, at the head of the right-hand fork, is an
excellent deposit that is favored by many of the women.</p>
<p>The nights are now without freezing temperatures that would
render the digging too difficult so the women begin to make
pottery. Early in the morning the potter leaves Cliff Palace
and sets out for her favorite clay bed. She carries a large basket
and a digging stick and is accompanied by any of her daughters
who are learning the art. The clay is usually soft and easy
to dig and she soon returns with a basket of blue-gray earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The clay is spread out in the sun to dry and all stones and
foreign particles are picked out. After drying thoroughly it is
ground very fine on a metate, the same flat stone on which corn
is ground. It is now ready for use.</p>
<p>The tempering material comes from an odd source. The
woman simply goes out on the trash pile below the cave and
picks up a quantity of broken pottery. This she grinds up just
as she did the clay until it looks like fine sand. This tempering
material is very important for it keeps the vessels from
shrinking and cracking as they dry. Many centuries ago the
ancestors of these women used sand and grit for temper. Some
still use them but most of the women use ground-up potsherds.
They are just as good and are much easier to obtain. Year
after year the broken pots have been ground up and used again.
Some of the particles the women are using today may have been
used by their ancestors centuries ago.</p>
<p>When the clay and the temper are ready they are mixed,
about one part of temper being used to two parts of clay. With
her fingers the potter mixes the dry materials very thoroughly
for a poor mix will give the pottery an uneven quality. Finally
she is satisfied and water is added until she has a thick, heavy
paste that does not stick to her hands as she works it. After
this paste has been very thoroughly kneaded, actual construction
of the pot begins.</p>
<p>From the mass of paste the potter pinches a small piece.
With the palm of her hand she rolls it on a smooth stone until
she has a rope of clay smaller in diameter than her little finger
and several inches in length. The paste is so strong that she
can pick the roll up without breaking it. Starting at one end she
begins to coil this rope of clay around and around on itself, just
as a snail shell is coiled. As she adds each coil she pinches it
to the last one with her thumb and forefinger. When the rope
of clay is completely coiled she rolls out another and adds it to
the first. Coil after coil she adds until the rough pot is completed.
At this point it is merely a long slender rope of clay
which has been coiled around and around, up and up, into the
desired shape, each coil being carefully pinched to the one below.
The spiral nature is very evident and hundreds of evenly
spaced thumbprints remain as evidence of the pinching together
of coils.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>If a cooking vessel is desired the inside of the jar is
smoothed carefully but the outside is left rough and corrugated.
Nothing is to be gained by smoothing and decorating the
outside of a cooking jar for it will soon be blackened with soot.</p>
<p>If a water jar, or a bowl is being made, the work is only
half done for it must be smoothed and decorated. Very carefully
the potter rubs the vessel until the inside and outside are
as smooth as she can make them. The vessel is still pliable
and by working with her hands and a curved piece of gourd rind
she can correct the shape slightly to make up for any mistakes
she made in the coiling. At last the vessel is smooth and
shapely and the potter is satisfied. She places it in the sun to
dry and begins to coil another.</p>
<p>After a number of vessels have dried thoroughly in the sun
the next step begins. From the mesa top, where it occurs just
under the red top soil, the potter has brought a quantity of
white clay. A small amount of this is ground up and mixed with
water until a white, soupy liquid results. This is the &ldquo;slip&rdquo;
and it is painted over the entire surface of the vessels giving
them a chalky, white covering. Before the slip has dried, each
pot is carefully polished with a smooth pebble. Short, brisk
strokes are used and the entire surface is polished until it
shines. This polishing is a tedious but important step for the
smoothness, luster and hardness of the finished vessel depend
upon it.</p>
<p>At last the pots are ready for the decorations and this is
the part the potter likes best of all. It is her opportunity to
demonstrate her creative ability. On Mesa Verde pottery the
designs are always black, a color that is made from a local
plant. Tender shoots of the common beeweed are boiled until
a thick, brown liquid results. Pottery designs are painted with
this liquid.</p>
<p>Out of thin air the woman snatches a design. She has a fierce
pride in her ability to create these designs for she knows that
later her finished pots will have to bear comparison with those
of her neighbors. No tracings or trial pictures are made. She
merely selects one of the sun-dried vessels, notes its size and
shape and develops in her mind a design that will fit it. Following
this mental picture she paints the vessel with the brown
liquid. The brush is a small piece of yucca leaf, one end of
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
which has been chewed to loosen the fibers. Her free-hand
strokes are swift and sure and soon the vessel bears an accurate,
carefully-balanced geometric design. At this stage it is
drab looking for the brown lines are not attractive.</p>
<p>At last, after many hours of tiresome work, the potter has
a number of pots ready for firing. This is the crucial step and
the excellence of the pottery depends upon its success. The
pots are carried down to one of the lower terraces at the front
of the cave and stacked in a shallow pit that has been scooped
out. Over them the potter piles the fuel; wood, bark and cakes
of rotting humus from under the trees. When it is ignited it
burns and smoulders, subjecting the pots to an intense heat.</p>
<p>When she is satisfied that the pottery is well-fired, she
rakes it out of the fire, polishes it with a piece of cloth or buckskin
and her work is finished. The brown paint has been changed
by the heat to a deep black that stands out in striking contrast
against the light gray background. From the simple ingredients;
clay, ground potsherds and beeweed, has come this beautiful,
enduring pottery. It is the highest artistic expression of the
Mesa Verde people.</p>
<p>As the potter finishes her work she places the finest pieces
in a row along the edge of the terrace or on her roof for all of
the women to see. The poorer pieces she puts back in the dark
corners of the house where they will not be noticed. Out of the
corner of her eyes she sees other women placing their pottery
on display and she smiles with satisfaction as she notes that
her work is as fine as any. There is much good-natured competition
among the women and each one tries to out-do her
neighbors.</p>
<p>As the spring progresses tremendous quantities of pottery
are made. All through the cave women are at work and pottery
in all stages of construction is to be seen along all of the terraces
and in every courtyard. Spring is the most popular time
for this task. The winter is too cold; in the summer water is
often scarce. During the spring all conditions are perfect and
the nimble fingers are busy until every household is equipped
with an ample supply of vessels of all kinds.</p>

<p>Occasionally, during the spring, a marriage takes place in
Cliff Palace. When this happens there is much excitement and
activity among the two clans affected. The clans are social
divisions within the tribe. Each individual is born into a clan
and that remains his social group throughout his life. In Cliff
Palace, with its large population, there are many clans while in
a small village there may be only one or two. The clans have
very little to do with the religious life; they are a part of the
social organization.</p>
<p>The pueblo society is matrilineal which merely means that
the line of descent is through the women, not through the men.
A child is born into its mother&rsquo;s clan, never into its father&rsquo;s.
Property also belongs to the women and inheritance is figured
through the female line. The husband lives with his wife in her
house and his children belong to her clan. Marriage can never
take place between two members of the same clan. This is a
rigidly enforced taboo and the boy and girl must belong to different
social groups. All of the members of a clan are considered
as brothers and sisters, consequently there is little
temptation to overstep this rule.</p>
<p>When a boy reaches the age of seventeen or eighteen and
seems to be growing into manhood, his family begins to think
of marriage for him. It is the responsibility of his elders to
arrange this for there can be little happiness for a single person
in a society of this type.</p>
<p>The boy himself has little opportunity for active romance.
For some time he has been sending highly expressive glances
in the direction of a certain young lady of a neighboring clan,
glances loaded with question marks, flattery and many other
signs from that most universal of all signal codes. Now and
then an answering message flashes from her warm, brown eyes.
In a very short while, and without a spoken word, an understanding
grows up between them. Each would like to slip away
to some quiet nook in the cliffs to take the matter up somewhat
more directly but it is virtually impossible and decidedly unwise.
The girl&rsquo;s mother and her aunts have not missed a single
one of those expressive glances. They do not disapprove in the
slightest but they never give the girl a chance to slip away into
the twilight. They may not distrust the girl but they certainly
do not trust the spring moon that bathes the canyons in its
warm, yellow light. Sometimes a young couple, unable to resist
the call, does slip away into the night but it is very foolish.
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
There is no secrecy in this crowded community and a twilight
tryst never goes unnoticed. The juicy morsel spreads for Cliff
Palace, being full of human beings, has its gossips. The marriage
value of the young lady is lowered.</p>
<p>In the normal course of events the young man who has been
carrying on the optical conversation with the young lady is
finally unable to curb his emotions. He goes to his favorite
uncle, or possibly to his mother and pours out his heart. Boasting
of his manhood and his hunting and farming abilities he
concludes that it is high time for him to have a home of his own.
And he would like to marry a certain young lady.</p>
<p>Immediately a family council is called and the proposition
is discussed at length. If the elders do not approve of the young
lady, the young man is immediately squelched. There is no
resisting the decision. The brokenhearted youngster will either
nurse his sorrow until another maiden captures his fancy or
meekly marry some girl whom his family selects.</p>
<p>Marriage is an important function and the union of strong
healthy boys and girls is a responsibility that falls on the older
clan members. Occasionally a headstrong youth who has allowed
a deep, long-distance love to grow upon him rebels
against a dictated marriage. In his heart, however, is an inborn,
confident reverence for his elders and he is soon frowned
into line.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the family council approves of his
judgment, a delegation is soon sent to talk with the family of
the girl. The virtues of the boy are extolled at great length and
there is a mention of certain presents that the boy&rsquo;s family will
give to the family of the girl. The relatives of the girl tell of
her virtue, industry and excellent health and let it be known that
certain presents will be expected.</p>
<p>If the two families fail to reach an agreement the romance
of the young couple is ended, but if they finally talk around to
happy settlement, the next step is up to the young lady. Shortly
after sunrise the next morning she goes to the boy&rsquo;s house and
for four days grinds corn in front of the boy&rsquo;s mother to prove
that she can do this most important work. It is a backbreaking
task but she keeps at it diligently, knowing that her work must
be satisfactory. At the end of the four-day period, the boy&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
relatives examine the results of her labor. If the amount of
corn meal does not please them the marriage is called off and
the heartbroken young lady returns to her house.</p>
<p>If, however, they are satisfied with her grinding the marriage
is agreed upon. It will not take place for weeks but there
is much to be done. The boy and his family must get the gifts
ready and it is the custom for the girl and her relatives to
build a house.</p>
<p>In addition to presents which his family has promised to
give to the girl&rsquo;s family, the boy makes certain personal presents
for his bride-to-be. He may make her a fine pair of sandals
and may weave her a soft, warm feather blanket or even a
beautiful white blanket of cotton.</p>
<p>The weaving of a cotton blanket may send him far afield. If
his near relatives do not happen to have enough cotton on hand,
he is forced to make a long journey to the south. The Mesa
Verde people do not raise cotton and it is obtained by trade
with tribes in the warmer lowlands. There are several men in
Cliff Palace and other nearby cliff dwellings who are in need of
cotton so an expedition is formed. These journeys are made
each year and many of the older men are familiar with the
route. Some of them act as guides for the young fellows who
are going for the first time.</p>
<p>The Mesa Verde lacks certain important things; salt, seashells,
cotton, turquoise and obsidian. In order to get these
articles the men trade with other Indians who live to the south.
Most of the men make occasional trading trips but some are
professional traders who spend much of their time on long
trading journeys.</p>
<p>For salt they must go to a salt lake 200 miles to the south.
The salt is gathered around the edge of the lake, either by the
men themselves or by other people with whom they trade. If
the salt is dry it is carried home in bags but if it is gathered
while wet, it is patted into balls which, when dried, are hard
as rocks.</p>
<p>Obsidian and turquoise are obtained far to the southeast,
near the big river. It is a journey of 200 miles to the turquoise
mine but the deep blue stones are the finest known and are well
worth the trip. Another source of turquoise is only 150 miles
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
to the east, across the high mountains, but the Mesa Verde
men seldom go in that direction. Hostile Indians live in the
mountains and the parties do not always return.</p>
<p>Sea shells come from the great ocean far to the southwest
but the men do not go all the way to the ocean for them. The
shells are traded from tribe to tribe as they move inland. By
the time the Mesa Verde men get them from Pueblo Indians
who live to the southwest, the price is very high.</p>
<p>Cotton, which will not grow in the Mesa Verde because of
the cool nights, must be obtained from other Pueblo Indians
who live to the south and southwest. It grows well in the warmer
lowlands and is one of the most important trade items. The
men trade for the raw cotton fibers, usually, and weave them
into blankets after they return home.</p>
<p>Trading expeditions are happy experiences for the men.
They not only love to travel and meet other people but they love
to trade. All along the route are villages of friendly Pueblo
Indians and the travelers are honored guests in these villages.
Traders are always welcome for they not only offer an opportunity
for trading but they bring news from far countries.</p>
<p>The departure of the trading party is a gala occasion and
all the people in Cliff Palace join to give it a noisy send-off.
It is the first expedition of the spring so a great many men are
in the party. As they start down the canyon, each man carries
a large pack on his back. Most of a man&rsquo;s burden consists of
the things he will offer in trade when he reaches his destination.
Perhaps he has tanned buckskin: the soft white leather has
great value in the lands to the south where deer are scarce.
He may have the skin of a spotted fawn he choked to death last
summer. For ceremonial use the skins must not be pierced
by arrows so the animals are caught and choked and such skins
are excellent for trading purposes. Also, he may carry a number
of large, highly-polished skinning blades made from a
banded stone found near the Mesa Verde. This stone is well
known over the pueblo region and the blades are highly prized.</p>
<p>In addition to his trading materials, a man carries his bow
and arrows, a blanket, a small bowl and a little food. He will
be able to kill rabbits, squirrels and rats along the way and
almost every night he will stop at a friendly village so little
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
food need be carried. A small amount of parched corn, some
dried meat and perhaps a little corn meal of a special type is
all he will need. The corn meal was prepared last fall for this
very purpose. At harvest time the fresh corn was roasted,
then ground into meal. This meal was thoroughly toasted and
again was ground, this time very fine. The meal is so well
cooked that a man need only stir it into a bowl of cold water to
have a nourishing drink. The men know all of the streams and
springs along the way so there will be no hardships unless they
meet enemy people.</p>
<p>In two weeks the men begin to return and at the end of the
month all are accounted for except a small party which went to
the southeast for turquoise and obsidian. They are long overdue
and at last the people give them up for lost. It merely
means that they encountered a band of nomadic, warlike Indians
and perished. Groups of savage hunters sometimes slip into
the Pueblo country to prey upon the peaceful farmers and the
pressure from these nomadic Indians is being felt more and
more. There was a time, many generations ago, when the Mesa
Verde people had no outside enemies and their villages were
scattered over a vast area. At that time they lived in open
pueblos out on the mesa tops and in all the broad valleys. Then
nomadic hunting Indians began to drift into the Pueblo country.
They raided the small villages, murdered the men, enslaved
the women and children and destroyed the crops. In the border
regions which were sparsely populated, village after village
was destroyed by the raiders. As the pressure increased, the
farming people deserted the valleys and the open mesa tops
and for the last few generations they have lived in the cliff
dwellings which they built in the caves of the Mesa Verde.</p>
<p>Cliff Palace has not yet been molested. It is in the midst of
a large group of cliff dwellings and the population is so great
the enemy people have not dared attack. But the men who have
returned from their trading journeys have brought news of increasing
enemy trouble in the surrounding regions and the
people know the threat is coming closer.</p>
<p>This spring only the one party of traders was lost to the
enemy. All the others have returned to the safety of their cave
home and they tell of their journeys in great detail. They were
received hospitably in Pueblo villages along the way and have
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
brought home a good supply of the things the Mesa Verde does
not provide; salt, turquoise, cotton and sea shells. They have
also brought news from all the country to the south. Fires
burn far into the night as the people listen to the tales from
the outer world. The young men who made their first trip have
become heroes and they make the most of the opportunity as
they tell magnificent tales of the things they have done and
seen. Most of them did well with their trading but a few gambled
and lost, and have returned with nothing but their loincloths.
That is not serious, however, and the great cave rings with
laughter as the people torment the unfortunate gamblers.</p>
<p>The young man who needed cotton for his marriage blanket
sets up a loom in his kiva and begins to weave. Older men in
the clan help him with the spinning and the blanket grows
steadily. The yarn is spun by hand until it is fine and even and
the young weaver listens attentively to the advice of the older
men as his weaving proceeds. This blanket is an expression
of his feelings for the young lady and he makes it as nearly
perfect as possible.</p>
<p>The bride-to-be is also busy for she and her relatives on
her mother&rsquo;s side must provide a house. The spot is chosen,
either beside her mother&rsquo;s house or on top of it and the walls
begin to rise. The house will be the property of the girl and
her wishes are respected but the real supervisor of operations
is her mother. She is experienced in such matters and her
tongue is sharp as she directs the many workers. All of the
girl&rsquo;s clan relatives help. The men do the heavy work of cutting
roof poles and shaping the stones while the mortar work and
plastering is the work of the women.</p>
<p>Stones for the house are not quarried. The men simply go
out along the canyon slopes and pick up small rocks which are
of the proper size, though of irregular shapes. As soon as a
large pile is accumulated they begin to dress the stones. A
few, well-directed blows from a heavy maul or hammer give a
stone the general shape desired, then a thorough dressing with
small pecking and rubbing stones gives it the final finish. The
sandstone is soft and the men are skillful, so in spite of the
simple tools the building stones are turned out surprisingly fast.</p>
<p>Mortar for the walls is prepared by the women. Gray clay
is generally used and it needs only the addition of water to make
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
a heavy, sticky mortar. The women do much of the work but
they often call on the men for help. As the walls rise, prayer
sticks are buried in the corners. These small, carved sticks
are offerings to the Gods and assure the stability of the house.
When the walls are as high as the builders&rsquo; heads, three or four
heavy poles are laid across as main roof supports. Over these
is spread a thatch of brush and withes and the roof is finished
off with a layer of adobe three or four inches thick.</p>
<p>It takes only a few days to build the house if the builders
are in a hurry but they seldom are. The house can be completed
long before the boy&rsquo;s weaving is finished, so the work is done
leisurely. House building is a pleasant task. All of the close
relatives in the girl&rsquo;s clan work together and the hours are
filled with laughter and practical jokes. There is much feasting
and, of course, a happy celebration when the house is finished.</p>
<p>As the little structure rises there is a deep satisfaction in
the hearts of the builders. They are helping a young couple
reach their ultimate goal. To the home-loving people this goal
is marriage, a home and children. Their lives point toward
that end.</p>
<p>This tiny room will be home to the young couple for the rest
of their lives. It is small, not over six by eight feet in size and
the roof is so low that the husband will have to duck his head
to miss the beams. The one door is very small, measuring only
sixteen inches in width and twenty-four inches in height. The
door sill is almost three feet above the floor and it will be
awkward for the short, chubby little bride who is scarcely five
feet tall. She will have difficulty straddling through the high
opening, and will not dare grow too fat in later years. Older
women often get so heavy that they can hardly squeeze through
the tiny doors. But it has always been the custom to make the
doors small and time-honored custom means more than the
comfort of fat women.</p>
<p>There are no windows in the house and it has no firepit.
Few of the women have fires inside their houses and cooking
is done in the courts. Some of the older women who suffer
from rheumatism and arthritis have fires in their houses but
the smoke is very bad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The final step in the construction of the house is the plastering.
This is left to the young bride-to-be and she does it
with loving care. A smooth coat of plaster, a few red designs
and the house is finished. Her husband will come to live in it
with her but it will always be her property. She is terribly
proud of it. Being uncivilized she feels that her home and
children will be the most important things in her life.</p>
<p>All of the houses in Cliff Palace are much like this one.
They are small, simple rooms that serve principally as sleeping
quarters and for the storage of possessions. Most of the
activities take place in the open courts and on the roofs of the
terraced structures so there is no need for large houses. They
would be difficult to warm in winter and would reduce the number
of families that could live in the cave.</p>
<p>After weeks, sometimes months, of leisurely preparation it
is time for the boy to move to the girl&rsquo;s house. He has finished
the presents he will give to her, the house has been built and
the two families have exchanged the presents originally agreed
upon. There is no actual wedding ceremony. The boy moves
his personal property; his clothing, weapons and tools from his
mother&rsquo;s house to the girl&rsquo;s house. They are now husband and
wife. Although he is only eighteen and she only fifteen they
have entered the serious phase of life and must bear their share
of the community responsibility.</p>
<p>The first few weeks of married life are difficult for the
young husband. He is living in the midst of his wife&rsquo;s relatives
who are watching him critically. If he fails to fit in, his life
will not be pleasant and the marriage may not last. Most marriages,
however, are successful for the young husbands, being
still pliable, are able to adjust themselves to their in-laws. In
some cases the house is not built until the young husband has
lived for a time with the wife&rsquo;s relatives and is fully approved
by them.</p>
<p>If the marriage is not a success, divorce is simple. Perhaps
the husband decides it is hopeless, not because he does
not love his wife, but because he can not stand her relatives.
He simply picks up his personal belongings and goes back to
his mother&rsquo;s house. If the wife decides to call it off, it is
equally direct. One day when he is out hunting or working in
the fields she throws all of his personal possessions out of her
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
house. When the husband returns, he cannot argue for all of
her relatives are there to defend her decision. So back to his
mother he goes.</p>
<p>If there are children in the family they remain with the
mother for children always belong to the mother&rsquo;s clan. They
will be cared for by her relatives until she marries again.</p>
<p>In April a period of frenzied activity begins for the men of
Cliff Palace. It will soon be planting time and the fields must
be prepared for that all-important time when the precious seeds
will be placed in the earth. The frost has left the soil and it is
dry enough to be worked so each morning the men and boys
trot up the trails to the mesa tops to spend the day preparing
the soil for planting. The fields are scattered far and wide
over the mesas. Most of the men from Cliff Palace have their
farms nearby but some trot miles across the flat mesa tops to
farm certain favored plots. These men who have descended
from a thousand years of farmers have an uncanny ability to
select the best areas for farming.</p>
<p>The fields are seldom large and they are never regular in
shape. An acre here, a few acres there, they dot the mesa tops,
the rich red soil standing out sharply against the green cover
of the vast &ldquo;green table.&rdquo; The heavy snows of winter have filled
the earth with moisture which will carry the crops through the
dry, hot weather of early summer. Then the late summer rains
will come and the worries of the farmers will be over.</p>
<p>Many of the men like to farm in the low draws above the
heads of the canyons. There is deep, rich soil there and a concentration
of moisture that produces the finest crops. Such
draws are not large but they make excellent farming areas. The
men even enlarge them by building terraces where the draws
are too narrow and steep for normal farming. Low dams of stones
are built across the drainage, seldom more than three or four
feet high and twenty or thirty feet long. The heavy rains of summer
wash rich soil from the mesas and deposit it behind the dams.
Soon each one becomes a terrace large enough for a few hills of
corn, beans or squash. Sometimes there are as many as a hundred
of these terraces in a single small draw. In a dry year,
when the plants on the mesa tops die from lack of moisture, these
terraces usually produce a crop. Even a slight rain causes water
to drain down across them and they assure a small harvest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The early spring work consists of clearing the trash and
weeds out of the fields and stirring up the soil for planting.
Dead weeds are pulled out of the ground and burned and the
first green weeds of spring are prodded out of the soil with
digging sticks. Some of the men even begin to stir up the soil
where they will later place the seeds. Corn is sometimes
planted almost a foot in the earth so each hill requires a great
deal of effort. The plants grow better if the soil is loosened
up so the men select the spots for the hills and begin to dig up
the soil and turn it over.</p>
<p>The only tool is a digging stick, a slender hardwood limb
that has one end sharpened into a chisel-like blade. Small digging
sticks may be only an inch screen in diameter and a foot in length
but the large ones are sometimes three inches in diameter and
five feet long. The upper end of the large ones is rounded into
a knob that serves as a handhold and near the base may be a
prong so the foot can be used in forcing the blade into the soil.</p>
<p>Sometimes a stone blade is attached to the digging stick.
The stone for these blades is found down across the big river,
forty miles to the southwest. That is a short easy journey:
the young men make the round trip in three or four days and
return with long slabs of stone. For days the men grind these
on pieces of sandstone until a long thin blade, two or three
inches wide and from six to ten inches in length, is formed.
The stone is a light tan color, with thin bands of red and brown
and it takes a beautiful polish. When one of these blades is
bound firmly to a long handle it makes a very serviceable tool
for turning up the soil and chopping out weeds.</p>
<p>While the men are preparing the fields the medicine men
are watching the weather very carefully. It is their duty to set
the planting date. There are countless signs they must take into
consideration. The return of certain birds from the south is
observed and the appearance and growth of spring plants is
watched carefully. The clouds and the sky are observed constantly
and the wind is tested many times a day. All of these
things have a meaning. Countless generations of medicine men
have developed a &ldquo;weather sense&rdquo; and barring occasional mistakes
they are quite accurate in their predictions.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The planting date finally will be set by the Sun Watcher, a
priest who throughout the year observes the movements of the
sun. Each evening, as planting time approaches, he stands on
the roof of his house and notes where the setting sun sinks behind
the western horizon. Each day it comes closer to a large
crack in the opposite canyon wall: when it reaches the crack it
will be planting time. The moon also is watched and the priests
note with satisfaction that a thin new moon is climbing higher
in the western sky each evening. Planting must be done while
the moon is growing larger. The corn will then grow as the
moon grows. If it is planted while the moon is waning the corn
will wither and die.</p>
<p>In addition to setting the planting date, the priests must also
perform certain ceremonies over the seeds that are to be planted.
Spring is not an important ceremonial season for the men are
too busy to spare time for the long, elaborate ceremonies.
Certain rites must be performed, however, and offerings must
be made to certain gods so they will smile upon the people. It
is a simple form of &ldquo;crop insurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fertility rites are especially important for unless the
gods of fertility and reproduction are pleased, the seeds will
rot in the ground without sprouting. Around the precious seeds
the priests and their helpers perform the ancient rites. Year
after year the ritual is the same; countless generations of
priests have developed this elaborate formula that is followed
in the finest detail. There is endless chanting, parts of the
legends are dramatized, and there are offerings of prayer
sticks, corn pollen, cornmeal and perfect ears of corn. If the
ceremonies are properly performed the germ gods will be
pleased and the seeds will sprout and grow well.</p>
<p>As the end of spring draws near everything is in readiness.
The germination ceremonies are over and the fields are ready
for the planting. The eager farmers await the nod of the priests
which will send them scurrying to the fields to plunge the seeds
into the earth.</p>
<p>In any normal year in the Mesa Verde there are several
days of rain about the middle of May. The farmers like to plant
their crops just before the rains come in order that they may
get the greatest benefit from the moisture. If the planting is
done too early, however, there is danger of late frosts so the
medicine men are in a dangerous position. If they sanction the
planting too soon, frosts may nip the tender young shoots, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
if they hold off too long the rains may come. Not only will the
planting be delayed many days but much of the benefit of the
moisture will be lost.</p>
<p>Carefully, the priests watch the signs. The birds, the plants,
the sun, the moon; everything goes through the regular progression
of spring. The sun is moving farther and farther to the
north and each evening the eyes of the people are on the Sun
Watcher as he makes his sunset observations. At last the important
day comes. As the sun sinks behind the horizon the Sun
Watcher climbs down from his house top and hurries to the
home of the Crier Chief. Immediately the Crier Chief steps
out on his roof to make the announcement. The sun, he tells
the waiting people, has reached the proper point; today it set
directly behind the crack in the opposite canyon wall. It is
planting time.</p>
<p>The next morning each man is off to his field at sunrise,
carrying the various items of equipment he will need. The seed
corn, only a small amount of which will be needed this first
day, is carried in a pouch made from the entire skin of a fawn.
The head and legs dangle grotesquely as the farmer throws the
pouch over his shoulder. At harvest time last fall the finest
ears of corn were selected for seed and ceremonies were performed
to assure germination and growth. During the winter
it was stored where it would be safe from dampness, mice and
weevils.</p>
<p>In addition to his pouch of corn the farmer carries his planting
stick, a plumed prayer stick and a small bag of corn meal.
As he leaves his house, bowls of water are poured over him by
the women of his household. This is symbolic of rain and will
cause the summer rains to fall upon the crops.</p>
<p>Upon reaching his field the farmer goes to a well-known spot
at the very center. With his digging stick he digs four holes,
each one almost a foot deep. The first hole is north of the center
spot, the second is to the west, the third is to the south and the
fourth is to the east. On the west side of the northern hole he
digs another which represents the sky regions and on the east
side of the southern hole another which represents the lower
regions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>In the center of the space bounded by the six holes he kneels,
facing the east and with cornmeal paints a cross on the ground.
Murmuring a prayer, he plants the plumed prayer stick in the
center of the cross and sprinkles it with cornmeal.</p>
<p>Now he moves out of the central space and opens his bag of
seed corn. Carefully he selects four grains of each color&mdash;yellow,
blue, red, white, speckled and black. Returning to the
central space, he kneels facing the northern hole and begins to
chant. At the proper point in the chant he drops the four yellow
grains into the hole. Shifting to the westward, he continues his
chant and drops the four blue grains into the western hole.
Chanting without a break, he goes from one hole to the next.
The red corn is dropped into the southern hole, the white corn
into the eastern hole, the speckled corn into the hole representing
the sky regions and the black corn into the hole representing
the lower regions.</p>
<p>Now the ceremony is over and he fills in the holes where the
seeds have been planted. Picking up his pouch of seed corn and
his planting stick, he plants four long rows of corn, each one starting
at his little central plot. One row extends to the north, another
to the west, another to the south and the final row to the east.</p>
<p>When his seed is exhausted, he is through for the day and
returns to the village. The rest of the field can not be planted
until four days have passed. During that time he will go through
many rituals of prayer, will place offerings at shrines and will
not eat forbidden foods. Also, he will avoid trading, gambling
and certain other pleasures.</p>
<p>After four days have passed, the remaining portions of each
field are planted. This is done without ceremony and as hurriedly
as possible for everything indicates that the May rains
are near. There is a light haze in the sky and the air feels
warm and damp. The moisture is in the air; only an east wind
is needed to bring it down. Planting must be completed, if possible,
before the east wind comes.</p>
<p>All of the men and boys, even some of the women, help with
the planting. Shortly after sunrise they leave the village and
scatter out to the many mesa-top fields. Food is brought to them
by groups of young girls and the planting continues almost without
interruption until sunset.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Planting methods are simple. A hole is dug, the seeds are
dropped in, and the earth is pushed back into the hole. Light
pressure with the foot compacts the moist soil about the seeds.
Corn is planted almost a foot deep and a dozen or more kernels
are placed in each hill. Beans and squash are given a shallower
planting with fewer seeds in the hills. Sometimes the corn,
beans and squash are planted in separate plots but often they
are all planted together in the same field.</p>
<p>There are no rows, simply individual hills planted from five
to eight feet apart with no effort toward orderliness. The only
care exercised in the location of the hills is that they must not
be in the same spot as those of last year. Enough stubs from
the last year&rsquo;s crop have been left in place to indicate where
not to plant. By changing the location of the hills each season
and by wide planting the men save the soil, for it may be years
before two hills are planted in the same spot.</p>
<p>The planting proceeds rapidly with the men digging the holes
and the boys and girls dropping the seeds. Plot after plot is
completed and the tension begins to lessen. In a few days every
field is planted and the happy farmers sit back to wait for the
rain. It is not long in coming. One evening the wind swings to
the east and during the night the people are awakened by the
pleasant sound of rain in the canyons. There are contented
smiles on their faces as they are lulled back to sleep by the
swishing waterfall that pours over the front of the cave.</p>
<p>The rain lasts for days. It is a soft, warm spring rain, a
female rain. There is none of the bluster that will come with
the male rains of late summer. Day and night it falls, and the
earth, well-loosened by the winter frosts, drinks up the moisture.</p>
<p>There is happiness in Cliff Palace for an abundant harvest
is now almost assured. The men gather in small groups along
the front terraces, chatting gaily as they watch the rain. In
their minds they see the grains of corn swell and burst, to send
thin green shoots toward the light. In spite of the rain and mud
some of them trot up to the mesa tops to look at the fields.
They know exactly how the fields look but still they must see
them. Nothing has happened. The earth is taking up the moisture,
weeds are shooting out of the ground, but none of their
plants have broken the surface. Drenched, they return to the
cave to spread the word that all is well up on the mesa top.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The rainy days are days of rest for the men but they are
days of strenuous activity for the women and girls. All of the
great water jars must be filled and stored away. As soon as
the spring rains are over the dry period will begin. It may be
two months before there is another drop of rain so the storage
of abundant supplies of water is of vital importance.</p>
<p>In the canyon below Cliff Palace is a series of dams. The
first one is just below the trash pile at the front of the cave
while the last one is far down the canyon. Several of the dams
are quite large, five or six feet in height and over twenty feet
in length. These dams are not like the farming terraces up on
the mesas. They are for water storage, so they are kept cleaned
out and are not allowed to silt up. Being made of large stones,
chinked with smaller stones and adobe, they act as perfect barriers
for the rain water that drains down the canyon. All of the
dams have been cleaned out and repaired during the spring and
the rain soon fills each one to overflowing. The great pools of
water thus retained sometimes last the people of Cliff Palace
until the summer rains come.</p>
<p>In addition to the storage pools the women also store great
quantities of water in their jars. Hundreds of the large vessels
have been made; each woman has several. As the rain sends
streams of clear water cascading down the cliffs the women fill
these jars and set them away in the cave, each one covered with
a close-fitting stone lid. Scattered through the city are innumerable
small rooms that are too small for living purposes.
They are for the storage of corn and beans. Many of the rooms
are still full of grain but some were emptied last winter and
they now make a perfect place for storage of the precious jars
of water. Long before the spring rains are over the jars are
all filled and safely stored away.</p>
<p>As the rains begin to show signs of subsiding the men keep
watchful eyes on the dams in the canyon. Some are built higher,
others are strengthened so that when the rains cease and the dry
weather begins they will be holding every possible drop of water.
The great pools are shaded by cliffs and trees and they will keep
the water cool and fresh far into the summer. With the water
that is contained in the pools and the water jars, and the daily
flow from nearby springs the people have little fear of water
shortage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>After several days of almost continuous rain the skies clear
and the sun beats down on a damp, green world. The warmth
and moisture cause every growing thing to reach for the sky.
Weeds spring up everywhere and after a few days the red soil
of the fields is broken by the green shoots of sprouting plants.
There is a splendid stand; the gods of fertility have heard the
prayers of the people.</p>
<p>As spring slips into summer the people of Cliff Palace seem
happy and contented. Everything indicates that a normal, prosperous
year is in store for them and they should face it with
light hearts. For the most part they do and during the spring
there has been much gaiety and happiness in the town. But often
the smiles are only on the surface&mdash;underneath is a deep, ever-present
fear. Sometimes, when all goes well, this fear is almost
forgotten. Then something happens and everyone is reminded
of the evil beings who are always present&mdash;witches!</p>
<p>From earliest childhood each person has been taught to fear
these creatures. Witches are evil human beings who have great
supernatural power. They have only one desire&mdash;to harm and
destroy people. Almost all diseases are caused by witches.
They shoot objects into people whom they wish to harm; stones,
rags, thorns, insects, bits of bone or even flesh from a corpse.
Sometimes they even steal a person&rsquo;s heart. When a witch uses
his power against anyone, death is the result unless a medicine
man breaks the evil spell.</p>
<p>Witches may injure a person or they may work against the
entire community. They bring on epidemics, they cause floods
and high winds and they can even keep the rain from falling. A
witch may not always be in human form; sometimes it takes
the form of a dog, a coyote or an owl. But always it is a menace
because of the desire to harm and destroy.</p>
<p>Only the medicine men can recognize witches and overpower
them, for they have the same power as the witches. But the
medicine men work for the people and there is a constant struggle
between them and the evil beings. If a person is ill, the
medicine man sucks out the object which a witch has shot into
his body. If a witch steals someone&rsquo;s heart, the medicine man
searches for it and restores it to the afflicted person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Since the people of Cliff Palace know that witches are always
present they try never to offend anyone. A next-door
neighbor, even a member of one&rsquo;s own family, may be a witch
and to offend him would be to invite disaster. Any person may
be a witch so the people are suspicious of all unusual actions.
If a man is jealous or constantly unhappy, if he roams about at
night, or if he is seen lurking outside a house where someone
is ill, he may find himself accused of witchcraft. For such a
man life becomes a miserable affair. He is shunned by everyone
and finally may be driven from the town. Or he may be
punished severely and, if he persists in his evil ways, may be
executed.</p>
<p>During the spring the witches have caused only a little trouble
in the town. There has been some illness and a few people
have died but it was nothing compared to what we shall see
when winter comes. That is the time when the witches will be
most active.</p>
<p>As spring ends the people are well satisfied with what they
have accomplished for all the necessary work has been done.
Houses have been repaired, new houses have been built and
several young couples have married. Hunting has been good and
the trading journeys, except for the loss of one party, were successful.
Several new fields were cleared, much pottery was
made and sufficient water is in storage. The fields have all
been planted and, above all, the spring ceremonies have been
performed.</p>
<p>The people of Cliff Palace are happy and contented as Spring
turns into summer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">5</span>
<br />SUMMER</h2>
<p>Summer is an easy time for the people of Cliff Palace, a
warm, lazy time. There are certain tasks to be performed but
there is also much leisure time for sleeping in the shade, gossiping,
gambling and trading. There is not the restless activity
which was so evident during the spring. Life proceeds at a
slow, easy pace.</p>
<p>The early summer is dry and warm. Little rain can be expected
until in July; sometimes it does not come until August.
The crops in the fields must live on the moisture stored in the
earth and the people must live on the water they have stored in
their pools and water jars, and the daily flow from the springs.
Water is always the critical problem but this year conditions
are very favorable.</p>
<p>June is often the hottest month of the summer. The sky is
cloudless and the sun beats down day after day, drawing the
moisture out of the earth. In the sun the temperature is high
but the shade is cool and pleasant. The air is dry and a light
breeze always blows across the mesa tops. The shade of even
a small tree brings relief from the warmth of the sun.</p>
<p>Little clothing is worn. The women have small aprons of
dangling yucca fiber strings while the men may wear loin-cloths
of buckskin or cotton cloth. Children wear nothing at all. Yucca
fiber sandals usually are worn by both men and women when
they leave the cave but they are not essential about the city itself.
The people of Cliff Palace are not clothes conscious and
with their rich brown skins they need no protection from the
sun. Even the men, who spend long hours in the sunny fields,
need no covering.</p>
<p>The farmers are all smiles for their crops are growing
prodigiously. Corn, beans and squash are growing well. Weeds
are also prospering and the men pull them up or chop them out
with their digging sticks. If the weeds are not destroyed, they
take moisture that the crops need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Every morning, not long after sunrise, the men trot up to
the fields. For a few hours they work industriously, chopping
weeds or loosening the soil around the plants. Earth is kept
piled up around the stalks of corn. It was planted almost a foot
deep and this heaping up of the earth around the hills puts the
roots even farther underground. At that depth there is an abundance
of moisture in the soil.</p>
<p>Along towards noon, when the sun is high over head and the
heat becomes noticeable, the men end their labors. Some of
them trot back down to the cave for a late breakfast. Others,
whose fields are farther from the town, have brought their
lunches and they spend the warm midday hours in the shade of
the trees which border their fields.</p>
<p>These men have a deep, inborn love for farming. They are
descended from a thousand years of successful farmers and a
fanatical desire to make things grow is in their blood. They
often go to the fields when there is nothing to be done. The
weeds have been cut, the soil is well loosened, everything is
just right. Still the men go to the fields to spend the hours
among the growing things. Every hill of corn, every bean plant
receives individual attention. Endlessly the men work about
the fields, even though they only pick an occasional bug off the
plants.</p>
<p>During the midday siesta the men often gather in little groups
and while away the hours telling of crops of the past or dreaming
of the harvest that is to come. Those hours are not always spent
idly for there are many tasks the men can do as they sit in the
shade. One man may chip arrowheads; another may whittle
away on his new bow. Here a man is patching his sandals while
his neighbor puts a new blade on his digging stick. Much can
be accomplished during these hours when the sun is high and
the shade is welcome.</p>
<p>The fields are never left without watchers. All day long
someone is on guard and even during the night the young men
and boys take turns watching the precious crops. Rabbits and
squirrels eat the beans, and ravens and crows pull up the tender
young corn plants. In a few hours a field can be ruined. Later
on in the summer, crows, jays and ravens will tear at the ears
of corn and eat great holes in the tender squashes. Even the
coyotes like the squashes and as one of the animals trots through
the field he may take great bites out of half a dozen. Faced
with this danger, the farmers are forced to watch the fields
day and night. The unmarried boys build brush shelters in the
fields and spend much of the summer there, dreaming of the
chubby little maidens for whom they will soon be farming.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The boys do not like to spend the night in the fields for
witches are most active during the hours of darkness and it is
a bad time to be away from the town. When a coyote howls or
an owl hoots, they know it may be a witch so they throw more
wood on their fires and smear ashes on their foreheads to keep
the witches away.</p>
<p>As the dry weather of summer continues the people show
much concern over the water supply. They know that if the late
summer rains come normally, they will have more than enough.
But if, as sometimes happens, the rains fail to come, they will
be in serious trouble. They prepare for this possibility by
carefully conserving the supplies. In order to save the water
that is stored in the jars and in the pools below the cave the
springs are utilized to the utmost. There are many of these
springs along the canyon walls at the foot of the cliffs. One of
the finest is across the canyon, under the great ceremonial
building where the priests hold their most important ceremonies.
It is almost half a mile by trail to the spring but it has a strong
flow of water. In spite of the long, tiresome journey, the water
must be saved. That is one of the tragedies in the lives of the
men. They are forced to carry the water home from distant
springs&mdash;on their wives&rsquo; heads.</p>
<p>Each morning the women make the round of the springs to
gather the water that has accumulated. At each place where
there is a seepage they have made a basin of well-tamped blue
shale. The water does not seep readily through this shale and
a pool of clear water results. The best springs are visited
several times a day so that the pools do not overflow. With
their long-handled ladles the women dip the water into their
jars, some of which hold as much as five gallons. The heavy
jars are then borne home on their heads. Years of practice
have given them strong necks, straight backs and a smooth,
flowing stride. They chat happily as they trot home with their
burdens: life is gay and easy with nothing to do but carry water
up out of the canyon. By carrying the water jars on their heads
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
the women have their hands free when they climb the rows of
toe-holds that are cut into the more precipitous cliffs. Ladders
that lead up over the terraced houses are simple: the water
carriers trot up them without deigning to touch their hands to
the poles.</p>
<p>Each woman has a small pad of yucca fibers, shaped like a
large doughnut, which she places between her head and the water
jar. This pad helps in balancing the burden and keeps her calloused
head from cracking the precious jar.</p>
<p>Every effort is made to conserve the water supply, for as
the warm weather continues the springs begin to dwindle and
the pools shrink. There is no repairing and building of houses;
water cannot be spared for the mortar. Pottery is seldom made
at this time for that, too, requires water. By using it only for
human needs the supply can be drawn out for months if necessary.</p>
<p>In addition to their water carrying activities the women are
also busy gathering the edible plants that are so common during
the summer. These plants add variety to the diet and help to
conserve the stores of grain. In June the mesa tops are covered
with flowers of all kinds and the women admire them and call
them by name as they search for the plants that have value as
food or medicine. The leaves and fruit of the prickly pear are
eaten; also the beautiful waxy flowers and the tender flower
stem of the yucca. Lily bulbs, wild onions, beeweed, sumac
berries and Mormon tea are only a few of the natural products
which the women gather. They know every seed, root, bulb,
berry and plant that has value and they search the mesas and
canyons in order to obtain these additional foods and flavors.</p>
<p>Occasionally the women interrupt the usual routine of their
daily tasks in order to give birth to babies. It is a pleasant
diversion for children are highly prized in this society. A
woman continues her regular work almost until time for the
happy event. Being strong and active she ordinarily goes through
it without great difficulty. Her mother is in charge of the affair
but if all does not go well, a medicine man is called in to
chant her through her troubles.</p>
<p>Shortly after birth the baby is bathed and is rubbed with
juniper ashes to protect it from witches and other evil influences.
It is then placed on a bed of hot sand and a perfect ear of corn
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
is kept always beside it. For twenty days the mother and child
are kept in the house away from strong light and every fifth day
the mother&rsquo;s hair is washed with yucca suds and she is bathed
with water in which juniper twigs have been boiled.</p>
<p>At sunrise on the twentieth day the child&rsquo;s head is washed.
Then its grandmother on its father&rsquo;s side takes it to the top of
the cliff and with a little ceremony of prayer, dedicates it to
the Sun Father. On this day it is named and since all of its
aunts and both grandmothers have the privilege of giving it a
name, the baby may receive a dozen. One name finally wins
out and the others are forgotten.</p>
<p>For several months the child is kept on a cradle board most
of the time. This is merely a thin, smooth board to which the
child is bound with soft folds of cotton cloth or buckskin and a
lacing of strings. No pillow is provided and the soft, pliable
head rests on the hard board month after month. The result is
obvious. Gradually the back of the head flattens until it fits
the board.</p>
<p>This change of head shape has no effect on the child except
in the matter of appearance. As the skull presses in at the
back it bulges out over the ears. The brain adjusts itself to
the changing shape of its container and suffers no ill effects.
As a result of the use of this hard cradle board, all of the people
have the deformity on the back of the head. Sometimes it
is terrific and the head is as wide as it is long.</p>
<p>The cradle board makes the care of the child very simple.
The mother may carry it on her back as she goes about her
work. She may hang it on a tree or on a roof pole or lean it
up against the house. When the child is on its cradle board it
is in no danger of rolling off the roof or over a cliff. Occasionally
it is taken off the cradle and the juniper bark pad that
serves as a diaper is changed. When the child reaches the age
where it must learn to walk, it will be released from the cradle
and will be placed in the constant care of an older sister or
some other little girl of its clan.</p>
<p>For the first six or seven years, children lead carefree
lives. They have no responsibilities and nothing is expected of
them except that they survive and be happy. If they do wrong
they are seldom punished physically but are talked to at great
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
length. And quite often they are frightened into good behavior
by tales of witches and what they do to bad children.</p>
<p>All of the children are up at dawn and the day&rsquo;s play begins.
The very young ones must stay within the cave where they climb
over the houses and play on the roofs and in the courts. After
they are a little older they play on the canyon slope below the
cave and finally they are big enough to play along the cliffs beside
the town. All through the day the echoes of their voices
and laughter fill the canyon.</p>
<p>At the age of six or seven, this life of constant play ends and
they begin to learn, by imitating their parents, all they must
know to fit into the life of the community. A little girl follows
her mother wherever she goes and imitates her in every activity.
When the mother makes pottery her small daughter makes
crude, miniature pieces: when the mother bakes corn cakes
her little shadow bakes tiny cakes of mud and, after a time, is
allowed to use the precious corn meal itself. When the mother
goes to the spring the little girl trots at her heels and soon she
is carrying small jars of water on her head. She spends long
hours at the grinding bin and equally long hours caring for
younger brothers and sisters. As she grows older, she accepts
more and more responsibility and finally, when marriage comes,
she is an accomplished housewife.</p>
<p>In the same manner the small boy goes through a long period
of training. At sunrise he tumbles out of his blankets to listen
and watch attentively as his father says his morning prayer and
tosses an offering of corn meal or corn pollen to the gods of
dawn. He follows his father to the fields and as soon as he is
old enough, accompanies him on hunting trips. When his father
makes bows, arrows, flint knives, bone awls and the many
other tools, the boy imitates him, in miniature, and gradually
learns all the necessary crafts.</p>
<p>Most important of all to the youth is his religious education
and this is in the hands of his &ldquo;ceremonial father.&rdquo; When the
boy was born one of his mother&rsquo;s brothers was selected for this
task and he is responsible for the religious training of his young
nephew. The two spend long hours together as the uncle tells
the legends and beliefs of the tribe. Since there is no written
language, these can be learned only through hearing them
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
repeated over and over. During the first years of training the
boy learns only the general things which all the people may
know but when he is twelve or fourteen he is ready for the
secret part of his religious training. Under the sponsorship of
his &ldquo;ceremonial father&rdquo; he is taken into one of the kivas and
initiated into the secret society to which his &ldquo;ceremonial father&rdquo;
belongs. Now he is taught the secrets of the society and its
ceremonies and soon he begins to take part in the ceremonial
work. From this time on the kiva plays an important part in
the young man&rsquo;s life. He goes there not only for ceremonial
purposes but to work, loaf, gamble or even to sleep. If his
mother&rsquo;s house is crowded with younger children, he may sleep
in his kiva most of the time until he marries. And even after
marriage he may sleep within the safe confines of the kiva during
occasional periods of strife in his home.</p>
<p>As the dry weather continues the men keep an anxious eye
on the sky. Certain conditions must develop before the rains
can come. In June there is a sigh of relief from the farmers.
The sky is no longer a solid canopy of blue. Along the northeastern
horizon great white clouds begin to appear. At first
they are small but each day they grow larger. Soon they are
tremendous, billowy, white thunderheads that boil up until they
cover half the sky. Soon they will break and the worries of the
farmers will be over.</p>
<p>The crops are growing well. By the end of June the corn is
almost knee high and the men thin it out. The weak stalks are
pulled out of each hill leaving the five or six strongest ones.
The fight against weeds is continued but during most of the
summer the men have a great deal of time for other activities.</p>
<p>During the times when they are not completely occupied with
their farms they work at their various crafts and as a result
there is much trading. Each man needs certain things such as
turkey feather blankets, cotton blankets, jewelry, tanned buckskin,
sandals, leggings, bows, arrows, planting sticks, stone
knives and scrapers, yucca fiber cords and ropes, axes, hammers,
and countless other things. Some of the men can and do
make any or all of these things. Most of the men, however,
specialize on the things they can do best and trade for their
other necessities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>In one house lives a man who makes splendid arrowheads.
Next door is an old fellow who is famous for his cotton blankets.
Upstairs is an axe maker and still higher, in the third story
house, is a man who specializes in tanning buckskin. Across
the court is a young fellow who is especially adept at twisting
yucca fibers into cords and ropes. In another part of the city
is one who makes feather blankets; somewhere else is a jeweler.
Some of the men make a number of different things but few of
them make all of the items they need.</p>
<p>The result of this semi-specialization is that there is much
trading. This is true not only within Cliff Palace but also between
the various villages. Within a mile of the large city are
more than thirty cliff dwellings. Up the canyon to the north are
ten and directly across the canyon, within easy calling distance,
are two very small ones. Around the point behind the great,
mesa-top, ceremonial building are five, down the canyon are
eleven and in the next canyon to the east are several more. In
more distant canyons are hundreds of other villages, large and
small.</p>
<p>Trails lead from one to the next and when a man needs something
he trots off to the place where he knows he can find it.
He spends the day at his trading even though he needs only a
single stone knife. He may visit two or three men who make
knives, haggling with each. In between times he gossips with
friends. When meal time comes he pulls up beside any convenient
food bowl and is a welcome though uninvited guest.
After overeating he takes a nap, then returns to his trading.
Toward the end of the day he makes a deal and sets out for
home. The same bargain could have been made early in the
morning but that would have robbed him of all the day&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<p>Since Cliff Palace is so large it is the scene of much trading,
for men from the smaller villages can find anything they want
somewhere in the city. Early in the morning they come trotting
up the trail to spend the day in the cool shadowy cave trading
for what they need. When the heat of the day is over they set
out for home with their new possessions.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Sometimes men of other tribes come to trade and there is
great excitement in the city. The strangers not only bring
beautiful jewelry and much-needed cotton and salt but they bring
news from the outside world. This is almost as important as
the actual objects of trade and before the trading can begin, the
people must hear what is going on outside their own little world.</p>
<p>The news that the welcome traders bring is of an infinite
variety. It may concern the weather, the crops, the hunting
conditions, or the private affairs of the people. The news may
be bad: somewhere a village has been visited by a scourge of
dysentery and half of the children are dead; in one region a
plague of grasshoppers has destroyed the crops; somewhere
else a forest fire has wiped out the entire population; in another
place the enemy tribes are becoming stronger and village after
village is being wiped out. There is no joy when these things
are told. But more often the news is good: there is a fine crop
of pinon nuts on a distant mountain; in a certain region the deer
are as thick as lice on an old man&rsquo;s head; a new vein of turquoise
has been discovered that yields hard, blue stones. Much
of the news is of a personal nature: there has been a murder;
in a certain village a woman has had triplets; a man has been
thrown out by his mother-in-law because he snored too loudly;
a certain priest is having miraculous luck with his healing ceremonies;
a deformed child has been born; a well-known chief
has gone blind.</p>
<p>Much of the news is pure gossip and it is repeated time after
time, gaining spice and details with each telling. There is no
restraint in discussions concerning intimate personal affairs
and every new bit of scandal is relished by the fireside listeners.
The travelers who bring news from distant regions expect an
even trade for they must return home with a full stock of news
for their own people.</p>
<p>The news which has the greatest effect upon the listeners is
that concerning the enemy raiders. For generations the threat
has been increasing. So far the Mesa Verde has not suffered
but the people know the danger is coming closer each year.
There are so many villages on the great, protective mesa that
they have always felt safe. In the caves are hundreds of cliff
dwellings, all easily defended, and since each village is within
shouting distance of the next, help could quickly be summoned.
But the savage raiders grow bolder and stronger. Sooner or
later they will come climbing up to the top of the Mesa Verde
to steal women and corn, even though it is a long way to go for
corn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Except for these alarming bits of news, the visits of the
traders are festive occasions. Everyone marvels at the things
they bring. The men bargain endlessly and the exchange of
news continues day after day. The women cook their finest
dishes and the dusty travelers are honored guests. After days
of friendly visiting and trading, they start back down the trail
bearing the good wishes of the people of Cliff Palace.</p>
<p>Gambling is also a common indulgence among the men and
much of the exchange of goods is through gambling rather than
trading. At any time of the day a knot of interested onlookers
can be seen somewhere in the city, silently watching some game
of chance. Anything that has the slightest value can be gambled.
The stakes may be only insignificant objects, or a man may
stake everything he possesses against a single fine piece of
jewelry. It may be a guessing contest, a game of skill, or a
pure game of chance in which small carved bones are thrown
on the floor and the winner is determined by the manner in
which the bones turn up. Someone wins, someone loses, and no
one is hurt. By a few days of diligent labor a man can replace
any of the things lost, except jewelry, which has the greatest
value of any of his possessions. Necklaces, pendants, and
earrings are made of turquoise, colored stones and sea shells.
Some of them are exquisite: the beads of turquoise or stone
are sometimes so fine that there are thousands of them on a
single necklace. Such a necklace requires weeks of painstaking
labor.</p>
<p>Toward the middle of July there is an ominous threat in the
air each afternoon. Billowing thunderheads fill the sky and turn
to a dark angry shade. Sudden gusts of wind rip across the
mesa tops threatening to uproot the corn and there is a distant
roll of thunder. The air is heavy and depressing. Each day
the skies become darker. Except for the men who are watching
fields, the people stay close to the cave. No one wants to be
far from shelter when the storm breaks.</p>
<p>At last the day comes. By noon the sky is filled with heavy
clouds. Shortly afternoon there is a sudden roar of wind. Cannonading
crashes of thunder echo constantly through the canyons
and searing tongues of lightning flick the treetops. Suddenly,
all is still. Not a leaf stirs; the world is breathless. The storm
draws back its arm for one quiet moment, then mercilessly
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
lashes the earth with floods of rain. Wind, thunder and lightning
resume and for a noisy hour the mesas bow their heads under
the wrath of the elements.</p>
<p>A roaring waterfall shoots out over the front of Cliff Palace
cave and from the bottom of the canyon comes the roar of a
rushing stream. The people are silent as they watch the storm
from their sheltered housetops. There is joy in their hearts,
for the rain ends all worries, but there is an ominous note in
the terrible fury of the storm. The male rains of summer are
often like this. They make a great show of noise and power,
far different from the gentle female rains of spring.</p>
<p>In an hour the storm ends as suddenly as it began. The rain
stops, the clouds break up and the sun beams down on a dripping
world.</p>
<p>Immediately the men are off to the fields to see if the crops
have suffered. The drenched watchers, whose brush shelters
were poor protection against the storm, assure them that little
damage has been done. Some of the corn is down but it will
straighten up. The only real loss is that a few terraces have
washed out but that is not serious for the terrace crops are
important only in dry years when the mesa-top fields fail.</p>
<p>There is great rejoicing in Cliff Palace. The harvests are
assured for now that the rains have started they will continue.
Every few days for the rest of the summer there will be a rain,
sometimes heavy, sometimes light. The danger of water shortage
is definitely ended. All of the pools are full of fresh water
and the springs will soon flow with renewed vigor as the rain
water reaches them. There is water in abundance and the
people no longer need to use it so sparingly.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the rains the heat is broken. The days
are cooler now and large, fluffy clouds float about the sky,
sending their cool shadows racing across the earth. The nights
are sometimes so cool that a feather blanket is necessary for
comfort.</p>
<p>As July turns into August the people are happy and contented.
All goes well; there are no threats to their security. The fields
are bursting with growth and the springs are flowing freely.
Those are the two important things in their lives. There is no
press of work at this time of the year and life is easy. The men
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
watch the fields and work leisurely at their various crafts.
The women still gather plants for food and now that there is an
abundance of water they make a little pottery and repair their
houses.</p>
<p>As always, the children are restless and active. They imitate
their elders, doing everything in miniature; miniature
farms, miniature bows and arrows, miniature houses and miniature
pottery. Sometimes they capture young animals; birds,
chipmunks, squirrels or rabbits and while away the hours in
more or less unsuccessful efforts to tame them. They are
never without their dogs and as they play about the canyons
they keep watchful eyes on their flocks of turkeys lest they stray
too far and fall prey to coyotes and foxes.</p>
<p>Life is full of joy for these children. Day after day they do
nothing but play Indian!</p>
<p>During the summer there is only one threat to the happiness
and security of the people. Only by terrific effort are the
medicine men able to avert a calamity that would wipe out the
entire population. One afternoon a terrified scream comes
from the small cliff dwelling across the canyon and a man is
seen dancing about on the cliff, waving his arms and pointing
frantically toward the sun.</p>
<p>Alarmed, the men shade their eyes and look at the sun as
best they can. Immediately they realize the awful calamity that
threatens them. Half of the sun has turned black; some frightful
monster is swallowing the Sun God. If it succeeds the world
will become dark and cold. Life will end.</p>
<p>Instantly the priests go into action and from the kivas come
the sounds of their frenzied chanting. Offerings are made,
prayers are sung: they perform every magic trick they know
that might force the monster to spit out the sun. Everyone in
the village joins in and the men come running from the fields.
Only a disaster like this could force them to leave the precious
crops. For a frenzied hour the hysterical people call upon their
gods to drive away the monster that threatens their Sun God.</p>
<p>For a time the blot on the sun grows larger, then, as the
priests redouble their efforts, it begins to diminish. At last it
is gone and the exhausted people give thanks to their gods.
Once again the power of the priests has saved them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>This thing has happened often, sometimes to the sun, sometimes
to the moon. Only a few years ago the monster swallowed
the moon completely. The oldest men can remember a time
when the sun was swallowed completely and the earth grew dark.
But in each case the power of the medicine men prevailed and
the moon and sun returned undiminished.</p>
<p>Emergencies of this kind give the people renewed faith in
their priests. Sometimes they fail to produce rain or cure the
sick but such failures can be overlooked when they are able to
overpower a demon which threatens the very existence of the
people. Never yet have they lost the battle against this demon
which threatens to swallow the moon or the sun. Surely their
power is supreme.</p>
<p>Throughout the year the priests have a regular round of
ceremonies. Fall and early winter is the great ceremonial
season but there are certain ceremonies that must be performed
at other times. Healing ceremonies are performed whenever
there is need. In the spring the fertility rites must be conducted
and during the summer certain ceremonies must be performed
which will cause the gods to send rain. In a dry year these rain
ceremonies are of utmost importance but in years like this one,
when the rains have already come, the ceremonies are more
in the nature of thanksgiving. Even though the gods have sent
the rain the ceremonies are performed. If they were neglected
the gods would be offended.</p>
<p>When the prescribed date arrives the elaborate ceremonies
begin. For days there are secret ceremonies in the kiva of the
religious society that conducts this particular rite. As a climax
the tired priests come out of the secret chamber and perform
the public part of the ceremony. Housetops are crowded as the
people gather to watch the costumed priests go through the
ritual that has been handed down through countless generations
of priests. Year after year it is the same but the people never
tire of it. Every chant, every offering, every bit of action has
a meaning. It is all a part of the yearly cycle of ceremonies
that brings happiness and prosperity to the people. This ceremonial
cycle is the responsibility of the priests and the people
have profound confidence in their abilities.</p>
<p>The people also have great confidence in their chiefs and in
the members of the council for these men govern the town. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
most important official is the Town Chief, an elderly man who
is noted for his wisdom, patience and understanding. He knows
many chants and ceremonies which help his people. Next in
importance is the War Chief, who guards against enemies,
witches and quarrels within the town. The Sun Chief or Sun
Watcher follows the movements of the sun and keeps the yearly
calendar, and his observations determine the dates for many of
the ceremonies. The Hunt Chief is in charge of the hunting
activities of the town as well as important healing and hunting
ceremonies. Another official who is prominent throughout the
year is the Crier Chief. He is the town crier and from his roof
he announces important news events and the dates of ceremonies,
village hunts and other important affairs.</p>
<p>In addition to these chiefs, there is a council composed of
the head men, or chiefs, of all the secret societies. When there
are problems to be settled, the council meets: perhaps someone
is accused of witchcraft, perhaps two clans are quarreling over
farm lands, or it may be merely a personal quarrel between
two men. A council meeting is called and the town chiefs and
the members of the council meet in a kiva with all the interested
parties. A council meeting may last for hours and there is
much shouting and quarreling as the evidence is presented.
After each person has had an opportunity to give his evidence
and opinions the Town Chief makes his decision and the trouble
is over. The Town Chief is considered to be wise and just and
his judgments are never questioned.</p>
<p>As the end of summer draws near there is new excitement
around the cooking fires and in the fields. It is green corn
time and the tender ears of corn are at last ready for use. The
corn plants are now as high as a man&rsquo;s head and although the
ears are fully formed, the kernels are tender and milky. They
are still white: the brilliant colors will not appear until they
begin to harden later on. Each day as the men come home from
the fields they bring baskets of corn to their wives. The fresh
corn is roasted, baked, boiled or stewed and great quantities
are eaten when the families gather around their food bowls for
the evening meal. Much of this green corn is also prepared for
winter use. It is roasted, ground into fine meal and carefully
stored away. When winter comes it will be made into delicious
mush and a thin gruel which will serve as a hot drink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Just as summer slips into autumn the corn fields are the
scene of a gay festival. Each day the men have examined the
ears and now that they are just right, the date is set. The Crier
Chief steps out on his roof, which overlooks the entire town,
and gaining the attention of the people, announces that the green
corn festival will be held in two days. His announcement brings
a great flurry of excitement and the women begin to prepare
for the feasting which will take place.</p>
<p>On the appointed day all who are able to climb the steep
trails hurry to the fields. Yesterday the men dug deep pits in
the fields and gathered great quantities of firewood. Hundreds
of ears of corn were picked and placed near the pits. Last night
fires were started in the pits and all through the night fuel was
thrown in to keep the fires roaring.</p>
<p>As the people arrive from the village the fires are allowed
to die out and the ashes are scraped out of the superheated pits.
Green corn stalks and leaves are used to line each pit and
everyone gathers around to toss in the hundreds of ears of unshucked,
green corn. When a pit is almost full, more corn
stalks are tossed in and the pit is sealed with earth. All through
the day the corn steams in the huge ovens.</p>
<p>Small fires are built around the edges of the fields and the
women and girls spend the day preparing great quantities of
food. The children romp about the fields while wrestling contests,
races and games of skill occupy the boys and young men.
The older men loaf and talk and, of course, gamble a little. As
the day passes the excitement mounts and at last, as the cool
evening breeze begins to rustle the corn leaves, the feasting
begins.</p>
<p>The pits are opened and the steaming, tender ears are passed
out to the famished crowd. It is a joyous feast for green corn
is a favorite delicacy. Great quantities of food are consumed
and a contented silence settles over the gorged, happy people.</p>
<p>Just as a monstrous full moon rises out of the eastern mesa
they return to their homes. They thrill at the sight for it is
something many of them seldom see. Cliff Palace cave faces
west and they can see the full moon only by climbing to the
mesa top.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>With the green corn festival over, summer slips quickly
into autumn. The slow, easy days of the growing season are
over. The strenuous activity of the harvest season faces the
people of Cliff Palace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">6</span>
<br />AUTUMN</h2>
<p>With the arrival of autumn the finest weather of the year
begins. For almost three months it will continue, until winter
sweeps down out of the north. In early September the days are
still warm but the nights have a pleasant coolness. As the season
progresses the daytime warmth continues but the nights
become cooler and cooler. By October they are crisp and finally
there is frost. The mesas flame with the colors of autumn,
the distant mountains are cloaked with a bluegray haze and for
weeks the people enjoy the brisk invigorating weather of Indian
Summer. Late in October, or in November, there may be a
quick flurry of snow, a warning of what is to come, but it disappears
as quickly as it came. Far into the autumn the warm
days last: sometimes the winter storms do not begin until after
the sun has started to return from the south.</p>
<p>Autumn is the happiest season of the year for the people of
the Mesa Verde. It is a season of tremendous activity for now
they must reap the rewards for the prayers of springtime and
the labors of summer. During the spring they were gay and
happy but it was not the full unrestrained happiness of autumn.
As the farmers planted their crops last spring they felt a certain
helplessness. With each tiny seed they planted a prayer:
that was the only aid they could give it. Then they were forced
to stand by while the forces of nature; the sun, the rain and the
earth, did as they pleased with the precious seeds.</p>
<p>Autumn has brought the rewards for their prayers and
labors. There is no uncertainty about it. Nature has smiled,
the fields have prospered and nothing can rob them of a bountiful
harvest. The cooling weather is turning the fields yellow and
a period of strenuous activity will soon begin. Every grain of
corn, every bean, every squash must be carried down to the
cave and stored safely away.</p>
<p>The fields are never left unattended. Ravens, crows and
jays try to get at the corn in the daytime and deer get into the
fields at night unless they are guarded. All through the night
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
bright fires burn in the fields as the men and boys take turns
protecting the crops. As they walk about the fields they gloat
over the success of their farming efforts. The corn is higher
than their heads and heavy ears bend toward the ground. The
bean vines are full of fat pods and the fields are dotted with
great yellowing squashes. It will be a wonderful harvest; the
fields are full of song and laughter as the proud farmers rejoice
over their success.</p>
<p>Even before the main harvest starts, the products begin to
trickle down to the cave. There is an abundance of help for even
the children and women join in. Each plant is given individual
attention and when an ear of corn, a bean pod or a squash ripens
too soon, it is picked and carried home.</p>
<p>As the first light frosts of October begin to bring color to
the mesas the harvest is on. Everyone helps and from dawn
until dusk the trails are full of happy carriers as the fields
pour their products into Cliff Palace. Many of the fields are
far off across the mesa tops and in a day&rsquo;s time each person
can make only a few trips.</p>
<p>A single, fat slippery squash is all that can be carried at
one time and it takes only a few large ears of corn to fill a
basket. Dozens of trips are required in harvesting even a small
field. Early in the morning the carriers trot down the trails
but as the day wears on the pace becomes slower.</p>
<p>Some of the corn is husked in the fields and only the ears
are carried home but much of it is snapped off the stalks and
taken home to be husked later. Sometimes the stalks are cut
and the entire plant is carried down to the cave for the stalks,
leaves, tassels and shucks are used in many ways. Beans
usually are threshed in the fields. The dry pods are piled on a
plot of hard, smooth ground and the women beat them with long
sticks until the beans are freed. Then the whole mass of beaten
pods is poured from baskets held high above their heads and
the breeze blows the chaff away, leaving only the clean beans.
Sometimes the beans are picked and carried down to the cave
for threshing but that is more difficult for in the cave there is
no breeze to blow away the chaff.</p>
<p>As the harvest progresses, Cliff Palace becomes a parade
of color. Everything must be spread out on the roofs and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
the courts to dry and soon the people can scarcely move about.
The corn is brilliantly tinted; red, black, blue, yellow, white
and speckled, and the city becomes a flaming riot of colors.
Corn is everywhere. It is piled high on the roof tops, it is
spread out in every court and long strings of brilliant ears hang
from the ends of roof poles. Piles of rich brown beans and
waxy yellow and green squashes add to the color and the confusion.
The terraced houses of Cliff Palace are now solid banks
of color and still the harvest continues.</p>
<p>Like busy brown ants the women and girls move about the
throbbing city. From morning until night they are busy shucking
corn, threshing beans, braiding strings of corn, turning the
corn and beans each day so they dry properly, and finally storing
them away in the bins. The storage of supplies is always a
responsibility of the women. While the things were growing in
the fields they belonged to the men but now that they have been
harvested and brought down to the city, they have become the
women&rsquo;s property. The women of each household, which is a
group of families, store their foodstuffs in common and apportion
them out to the various families as they are needed.</p>
<p>Some of the corn is shelled and stored in baskets but most
of it is stored on the cob. The different colors are sorted out
and the bright ears are stacked like cordwood. The beans must
be stored in baskets and jars but the squashes can be piled
anywhere. Many of the squashes are peeled and cut into long
strips. After the strips have dried they are rolled up in bundles
and stored away. In the winter, soaking will restore the flavor
of the fresh squash.</p>
<p>High up in the back of the cave is a long, narrow crevice
containing a dozen large storage rooms and throughout the town
there are many more. They have been chinked carefully against
rats and mice and each one is lined with dry corn leaves and
tassels to protect the grain from dampness. One after another
these rooms are filled and the doors are sealed.</p>
<p>When the harvest finally ends there are enough beans and
corn in storage to last not only until the next harvest, but on
through two or three years if coming harvests should fail. By
carefully conserving the supplies the people could survive two
or three seasons of drouth. That is the possibility for which
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
they must always be prepared, for normal harvests do not come
every year.</p>
<p>All through the harvest the workers have watched for perfect
ears of corn and when found they were put aside. These will
be saved for seed and they are stored separately in the safest,
driest places. Even though planting time is months away small
ceremonies are performed over these precious ears.</p>
<p>Although the agricultural products are of first importance
to the people of Cliff Palace, there are in addition countless
wild products that they must gather and store away. Throughout
the autumn, when they are not busy with their harvest, they
search the mesas and canyons for these natural foodstuffs.
Corn, beans, and squash would be a tiresome diet so meat, nuts,
roots, fruit, seeds and berries are needed.</p>
<p>This year there is a splendid crop of pinon nuts and the
women and children are busy gathering them. The early frosts
have opened the cones and the ground under each pinon tree is
covered with brown nuts that are scarcely larger than beans.
Squirrels, chipmunks and Indians engage in a lively contest for
them but there are more than enough for all. They are stored
away in baskets to be eaten later in the winter. Usually they
are cracked one at a time with the teeth and eaten raw but sometimes
they are ground, shell and all, into an oily butter and
eaten with corn bread. Pinon nuts are highly prized but they
cannot be depended upon regularly. Sometimes several years
elapse between crops.</p>
<p>In addition to pinon nuts many other plant products are
gathered, dried and stored for the winter. Yucca pods, cactus
fruits, berries, roots and seeds all have their uses. Medicinal
herbs are also gathered as well as plants that will be needed
for dying cotton cloth and buckskin. Bundles of drying plants
hang on the walls of every house.</p>
<p>During the summer there was little hunting, for the deer
and mountain sheep drifted north into the higher country. Now
they are returning and as soon as the harvest is over, the men
begin to lay in the winter&rsquo;s supply of meat. Hunting parties
vary in size from one man to all of the men in the town and
there are always important ceremonial preparations. Prayer
sticks are made, prayers are said and each man carries a tiny
stone image of some animal, such as the mountain lion, which
is a good hunter. When the organized town hunts are planned,
the hunt society holds ceremonies in its kiva the night before
the hunt begins. Unless these ceremonial preparations are
made, a hunt cannot be successful. If a man were to neglect
the ceremonies it would be worse than if he were to forget to
take his weapons.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>If one man or a small party of men goes out after deer or
mountain sheep, they usually stalk the animals and shoot them
with their bows and arrows. The men know the game trails and
waterholes and by careful, patient stalking, they are able to get
within shooting distance. If deer skins are needed for ceremonial
purposes, the men run the animals down and choke them
to death for ceremonial skins must not be pierced by arrows.
When a deer finds that it is being pursued, it becomes too
nervous to eat or drink. As the man follows it hour after hour
he imitates the cries of coyotes or wolves and after a time the
animal is frightened to the point of exhaustion and the man is
able to catch it, throw it down and choke it to death.</p>
<p>Dates for the organized hunts, in which all of the men of the
town take part, are set by the Hunt Chief and announced by the
Crier Chief. When the large groups of men go hunting they
either drive the game out on a high point between two canyons
or form a large circle and drive the game to the center. The
mesa south of Cliff Palace is an excellent place for a game
drive for it is narrow and the cliffs are very high. When the
Hunt Chief learns that deer or mountain sheep are on this mesa,
a hunt is announced and early the next morning the men leave
the town. Forming a long line across the mesa they drive the
game toward the point. The cliffs are so high the animals cannot
leave the mesa top and soon they are cornered on the point
of the mesa with a solid line of men blocking their escape.
The animals are killed with arrows and clubs and any that dash
over the cliff are picked up below.</p>
<p>When a surround hunt has been announced the men go north
on the mesa to areas where game is especially plentiful. The
easiest way is for them to split into two parties and move up
two canyons which are parallel. When a signal is given the
men swarm up out of the canyons and form a circle which at
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
first may be a mile in diameter. With much shouting they move
toward the center and soon all the deer, mountain sheep, foxes,
coyotes, and rabbits which were in the area are surrounded by
a tight circle of men. As the frightened animals try to dash
out of the circle they are killed with arrows and clubs.</p>
<p>When hunting parties return the game is turned over to the
women and girls. The animals are skinned and the meat is cut
into long strips. Strings are tied to pegs in the house walls and
to the ends of roof beams and soon the houses are festooned
with drying meat. Almost every part of an animal is used. The
meat and most of the internal organs are eaten, the hide is
tanned for clothing, sinews are used for bow strings and for
sewing and the bones are made into tools. All through the late
fall, hunting continues and for weeks the cave reeks with the
strong odor of drying meat.</p>
<p>Throughout the fall the harvesting and hunting activities occupy
the people of Cliff Palace. When evening comes they are
tired from their labors but they are happy as they sit around
the fires which have been lighted to drive off the chill. They
face the winter with light hearts for the walls are bulging with
the supplies of food that have been stored away.</p>
<p>It is the same all over the Mesa Verde. In every cliff dwelling
there is contentment. This has been a good year for the
entire tribe and the people are enjoying the reward that has
come from their labors.</p>
<p>Even though the strenuous harvest days are over the people
are still busy. A cold winter is coming and preparations must
be made for it. When December and January come there will
be snow and ice. Bitter winds will sweep across the mesa and
the shadowy depths of the cave will be cold. An abundance of
warm clothing will be required if the people are to enjoy any
comfort during the winter.</p>
<p>The most important articles of clothing are the feather
blankets. Weaving them is a slow, tedious task but they are
splendid protection against the cold. In making a feather blanket
only two things are used; small, fluffy turkey feathers and
heavy, yucca cord. The feathers are split down the middle and
wrapped in a very tight spiral around the cord. A soft, fluffy
feather rope results; hundreds of feet are needed for a single
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
blanket. When enough of the feather rope has been made, it is
woven into a blanket that is as soft and warm as a fur robe.
The men who make these blankets are busy making new ones
and repairing old ones. Each person will need one when cold
weather comes.</p>
<p>Other men weave new cotton blankets and some of the boys
are sent off to the south for more cotton. Cotton robes are not
as warm as those made of feathers but they give added warmth
when they are worn next to the skin under the feather blankets.
When a feather blanket is old and worn some of the feather ends
loosen and a cotton under-blanket is needed to prevent scratching.</p>
<p>Deer and mountain sheep skins are tanned into soft white
leather. By using bone awls and needles the women sew the
skins together with yucca fiber or cotton string and make large
robes. A few sleeveless slip-over buckskin jackets are made
but most of the people prefer the loose robes. Yucca fiber
sandals are worn throughout the year but in the winter grass
and juniper bark are sometimes bound to the foot by the sandal
lacings and extra warmth is provided. Short leggings, made
from buckskin or woven of human hair, are often worn by the
men when they leave the cave.</p>
<p>As winter draws near and the threat of cold weather comes
close the people check their clothing needs carefully. Each
man, woman and child will need certain things so the weaving
and sewing continue until everyone is well supplied. With the
bountiful supplies of food, an abundance of fuel, and a good stock
of clothing the people are able to face the dreary months of
winter with less dread. They hate to see winter come for there
will be suffering and sadness. But only winter can lead to
spring so they must accept it.</p>
<p>In the late fall, when the rush of harvest is over and the
preparations for winter are well under way, the men begin to
think of ceremonies. This is the season for the greatest ceremonial
activity and the men are often busy carrying out the
rituals that are prescribed by their elaborate ceremonial
calendar.</p>
<p>At almost any time of the year a ceremony of some kind is
going on in Cliff Palace. It may be only a simple bit of ritual
occupying a single medicine man or it may be an elaborate
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
ceremony that occupies an entire religious society for many
days. The priests of each society have a ceremonial calendar
and as the seasons roll around they perform their ancient
rituals. When, why and how those ceremonies originated they
do not know. They learned them from their elders and they
will pass them on to the younger men who will succeed them.</p>
<p>Throughout the year many ceremonies are held but the important
ceremonial season comes in the late fall and winter.
The work of spring, summer and fall is over and the men now
have ample time for the involved rituals that keep them in tune
with the powers that control the universe. These powers, or
gods, are many and varied and strangely, they are both good
and bad. The effort of the priests, then, is to call upon the good
gods to help the people and to influence the bad gods to leave
them alone.</p>
<p>Most important of all the powers is the Sun, who is the
Father, and closely allied is the Earth Mother. In addition
there are gods who control rain, growth of plants, fertility, the
flow of springs and countless other things. Added to these are
innumerable lesser supernatural beings who can help or harm
the people. All nature is full of powers and it is the business
of the medicine men to keep the whole complicated system in
tune. It is not so much a worship of the forces of nature as a
recognition of these forces. If they work smoothly together,
life flows evenly and properly. If there is discord among the
natural forces the people suffer. To them it means that some
god is not pleased. The result is drouth, pestilence, famine,
or any of the other curses that occasionally fall upon them.</p>
<p>In order to explain all of the acts of nature which influence
the people, there is a tremendous mass of legends and myths.
The origin of the universe and the origin of all life, including
the people themselves, is contained in these myths. For every
condition or act of nature there is an involved mythological explanation.
The medicine men must keep this legendary background
in order and they must faithfully carry out the yearly
program of ceremonies. One of their most important duties
is the training of the younger men. Just as they themselves
received the myths and rituals from their elders so must they
in turn pass them on to the men who will follow them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>In each generation a certain number of the men are concerned
almost entirely with religious matters. They are the
medicine men, or priests, to whom is entrusted the responsibility
of the delicate adjustments between man and the forces
of nature. Each religious society has one or more full-fledged
medicine men and a number of younger men who are learning
the profession. In addition, all of the other men of the society
know a great deal about the mythological background and the
ceremonies. Consequently, the men spend a great deal of
time in religious work.</p>
<p>Cliff Palace has twenty-three kivas and a large number of
secret religious societies. All of the societies have the same
general beliefs and background but each society splits off from
the main mythological stem and has certain phases of the religious
work to carry out. The function of the various societies
is to control the weather, bring rain, promote fertility and
crops, assure successful hunts, control the sun and the seasons,
cure sickness, combat witches and promote the general welfare
of the people.</p>
<p>When a boy is twelve or fourteen years of age, he is initiated
into one of the societies, usually into the one to which his
&ldquo;ceremonial father&rdquo; belongs. This &ldquo;ceremonial father&rdquo; is the
uncle who was chosen to be the boy&rsquo;s adviser and sponsor and
it is natural for the boy to follow him. The uncles on the
mother&rsquo;s side are in many ways closer to a boy than is his own
father. The father belongs to a different clan and while he lives
with his family, in his wife&rsquo;s house, he spends a great deal of
time with his own clan group where he may be the &ldquo;ceremonial
father&rdquo; of one of his small nephews. Since marriage cannot
take place between two members of the same clan the father
is, to a certain extent, an outsider who has little to do with the
religious training of his sons. Maternal uncles take the father&rsquo;s
place in this matter.</p>
<p>During the fall, the initiation ceremonies take place and the
training of the boys begins. They must learn the legends, the
rituals and the endless chants so they can bear their share of
the ceremonial work. The few boys who are selected to be
medicine men will do little else but sit at the feet of the older
medicine men for a score of years. When their teachers die,
they will be able to step into their places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The initiation and the training take place in the kivas. Night
after night, through the fall and winter, the great cave resounds
with the chants of the priests as they perform the ceremonies
or teach them to the newly initiated members. Much of the
legendary material is in the form of endless songs and the men
never tire of them. Hour after hour they sit around the kiva
fires, eyes closed, chanting softly the musical prayers and
legends. Often the chanting continues through the night: now
that the season&rsquo;s strenuous work is over the men are able to
spend the nights with their ceremonies and rest in the daytime.</p>
<p>Most of the activities of a society take place in its kiva,
which is a ceremonial room, work shop, club room and often,
a sleeping chamber. During most of the year it serves as a
club room for the men. When the time for a ceremony arrives
it becomes a sacred, religious chamber. After the conclusion
of the ceremony it is again a loafing place and work room.
Women usually enter the kivas only on occasions when they take
part in the ceremonies, or are invited in to witness them.</p>
<p>An unmarried boy, after being initiated, often sleeps in the
kiva of his society. His mother&rsquo;s house may be crowded with
younger children so the warm, underground room is much more
pleasant. Married men very often sleep in the kiva, too, but
for different reasons. When a man marries, he goes to live
with his wife in the midst of her clan relatives. Often he remains,
in a sense, an outsider. While he prizes his family and
his home, he prizes, also, his kiva sanctuary. When his house
becomes too full of words, he can retire to the peace and quiet
and good fellowship of this club room which protects him from
family troubles.</p>
<p>A typical kiva is a circular, subterranean room, twelve to
fourteen feet in diameter and seven or eight feet deep. Its walls
are faced with stone to hold back the surrounding earth. At a
height of about three feet from the floor the walls are stepped
back so there is a ledge or shelf, at least a foot wide running
entirely around the room. Resting on this ledge are six small
masonry pillars, evenly spaced around the room, that support
the roof. These pillars divide the space above the ledge into
six recesses, the one to the south usually being deeper than the
rest. The tops of the pillars are a couple of feet below the
ground level and this space is built up with a cribbing of logs
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
on which rests the roof of logs and adobe. The only door is a
small hatchway in the center of the roof.</p>
<p>The kiva is entered by means of a ladder which rests on the
floor and extends up through the small door. This door is also
the smokehole for directly below it in the center of the kiva
floor is a firepit. Fresh air is brought into the room through
a small, vertical shaft back of the deep recess on the south side
of the kiva. The top of the shaft is a small opening in the courtyard
while the bottom opens into the kiva just above the floor.
As the smoke and hot air rise through the doorway fresh air is
drawn down the ventilator shaft. Between the ventilator opening
and the firepit is a small masonry screen, or deflector, that
keeps the fresh air from blowing across the fire.</p>
<p>On the other side of the firepit, opposite the deflector, is a
small hole in the kiva floor, three or four inches in diameter
and only slightly deeper. This small opening is of extreme importance
to the priests. It is the sipapu, the symbolic entrance
to the underworld. Many of the gods live in the Mother Earth
and the prayers of the medicine men reach them through the
small opening. The hole is merely a symbol. It represents the
opening through which the Indians feel they themselves and all
other living things emerged from the Earth Mother.</p>
<p>The people believe the Sun is their father and the Earth their
mother. After the union of the two, the people and all other
creatures first came into being in a dark cave in the center of
the earth, the world of darkness. After a time they climbed up
to another cave where there was a little light. This was the
world of twilight. For a short time they lived in this twilight
world, then they climbed to another cave with still more light,
the world of dawn. Finally, they emerged through a small hole
in the earth, Sipapu, and were in the present world. All other
creatures emerged just as they did; all life came from the
Mother Earth.</p>
<p>The little hole in the kiva floor is merely a symbolic sipapu,
representing that original Sipapu through which the people
emerged from the Mother Earth. It is a symbolic entrance to
the spirit world below. During the ceremonies, offerings are
placed in the hole or around it and the priests send their prayers
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
through it to the gods who live in the underworld. And when a
person dies, his spirit goes back through Sipapu to a pleasant
afterworld within the Earth Mother.</p>
<p>When a ceremony is in progress, the kiva is sacred to the
members of the society. Food is brought to them by the women
and they eat and sleep in the kiva, leaving it only to perform
ceremonial errands. Day and night they follow the sacred ritual,
preparing their paraphernalia, recounting legends, chanting
endless prayers, making offerings to the gods and performing
the various ceremonial acts that are prescribed.</p>
<p>In some of the ceremonies the costumed priests emerge
from the kiva and perform public dances or rituals. The villagers
gather on the roofs surrounding the dance court and
watch with serious reverence. They know these ceremonies
are necessary if the delicate adjustment is to be maintained
between the people and the mysterious powers which affect them.</p>
<p>At the end of the ceremony the kiva becomes a club room
and workshop again. Paraphernalia is stored away on the ledges
or in small niches in the kiva walls and normal life resumes.
A kiva presents a varied scene, for any activity carried on by
the men may be performed there. Undisturbed by outsiders
they work, loaf, gamble, gossip, trade and sleep in this room
which is their most prized possession. Since the women own
the homes the kiva is the only bit of real property the men can
call their own.</p>
<p>Because of the strange social and religious customs a man&rsquo;s
life is divided into three parts. His family life centers about
his wife&rsquo;s house for there live the wife and children whom he
cherishes and for whom he provides. His social life centers
about his mother&rsquo;s home for there lies his clan affiliation. His
religious life centers in the kiva which belongs to his religious
society or fraternity. These three interests do not conflict.
They dovetail perfectly, each taking its proper share of the
man&rsquo;s time and attention.</p>
<p>The life of a woman is much less complicated. Most of her
activities concern the home and family and her full time is occupied
with them.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Some of the most important religious duties of the men are
concerned with a great ceremonial building which stands on the
mesa top just across the canyon from Cliff Palace. It is a
massive, D-shaped building which dominates a high, narrow
point between two canyons. Near it are a number of cliff dwellings
and the men from all these joined in constructing the building.
On days when it is used, priests and men from all the villages
come trotting up the trails to join in the performance of
the elaborate ceremonies. It is a superceremonial structure
where only the most important rites are performed.</p>
<p>When the building was constructed, the priests planned it
very carefully. The main building is D-shaped, with the straight
wall to the south. The outside wall is double and in the space
between are a number of long narrow rooms, some without
doorways. In the court enclosed by the walls are two kivas.
This part of the building is symmetrical, the result of the very
careful planning of the priests. On the west end of the building
is an addition consisting of a kiva and ten rooms, all added in
such a way that the entire building is still D-shaped. The
building has no roof and all of the walls are over a dozen feet
high. Half of the rooms have no doors; they are deep, small
rooms entered by ladders.</p>
<p>This building is open to the sun and the elements, in this
respect being entirely different from the underground kivas.
The thick, high, double walls and the location on the isolated
point give the priests the secrecy they desire and in this unique
building are held the greatest of all the ceremonies. Long ago
the priests of the various villages decided there was a need for
this community place of worship. By concerted effort they
built it and through the cooperation of the many societies they
have carried on the ceremonies. It is their supreme effort toward
a perfect adjustment with the powers that control their
destiny.</p>
<p>During the late fall and early winter the ceremonial season
is in full swing and there is much festivity in Cliff Palace. It
is a time for visiting and feasting and there is a trace of the
carnival spirit in the air. The ceremonies are not entirely
solemn, long-faced affairs; some have light, entertaining parts
and there may even be clowns who convulse the onlookers with
their antics. The underlying motive of a ceremony is serious
and earnest but this does not prevent its being thoroughly enjoyable
to the participants as well as the audience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Visitors are drawn to the ceremonies from far and wide.
Their strongest desire may be to see an important ceremony
but even more often the strongest motive is the desire to join
in the festivities that accompany it. There is always a gay
crowd, much talking and visiting and an abundance of good food.
When the Crier Chief announces the date for a ceremony, the
news spreads rapidly and the men of other villages come flocking
in. It is a grand excuse for a visit to the big city to feast,
gossip, trade, and incidentally, to witness a ceremony.</p>
<p>Although the women play only a small part in the religious
work, they are always busy during the ceremonies for they must
feed the participants and the visitors. The ceremony may last
for as many as nine days and large quantities of food must be
prepared. The women and girls are busy over the cooking fires
day after day.</p>
<p>The basic food article is corn in some form; it is the backbone
of every meal. Corn is by far the most abundant foodstuff
and through the generations the women have devised many ways
of cooking it to prevent its becoming monotonous. The corn is
ground by the younger women on the metates, smooth flat stones
that are slanted into small bins. Under the lower end of each
metate is a clean adobe basin that gathers the meal. The woman
kneels at the upper end of the metate, places the corn on it, and
grinds it with a smaller, flat stone, the mano, which she holds
in her hands. Sliding the mano back and forth across the metate
she grinds the corn until a fine meal results. This is slow
back-breaking work but the women are forced to do it day after
day. When a great deal of meal must be produced for a ceremonial
feast, several of the women grind together. Often the
young men sing for the grinders and a fast snappy tune not only
cheers the women but causes the grinding stones to move much
faster.</p>
<p>After the corn meal is prepared it can be cooked in a number
of ways. The simple batter may be baked in small cakes on a
hot stone. Juniper ashes may be added to make the cakes blue.
The dough may be rolled in corn husks and baked in the ashes
or large cakes may be baked in hot pits. If fine and coarse
corn meal are mixed, rolled into little balls and boiled in a pot
of stew, tasty dumplings result.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>A real delicacy results when the corn bread is sweetened
with saliva. In making this sweet bread a portion of the corn
meal is chewed by the women until the saliva changes the starch
to sugar. When this chewed meal is mixed with the rest of the
meal and baked in corn husks, a sweet bread results. If the
chewed batter is rolled up in fresh corn leaves and boiled, the
resulting dumpling-like balls are the sweetest food known to
the people. The chewed foods are real delicacies and are made
especially for honored guests.</p>
<p>In addition to the corn dishes, there is a great variety of
other foods. Meat of all kinds is roasted, boiled or stewed.
Broths, soups and stews are common. Boiled beans and baked
squash are always part of a feast and any of these articles may
be cooked in combination. In addition there are wild plant dishes;
boiled greens, boiled or baked roots, stewed fruits, roasted
seeds or ground pinon nuts.</p>
<p>Fall is the time when there is the greatest abundance and
variety of foods and the feasts that accompany the ceremonies
are sumptuous affairs. The finest dishes are passed down into
the kivas to the priests. Guests eat in the open courts around
the cooking fires and drowsily belch their gratitude for the food
and hospitality.</p>
<p>In the evening the people gather around the many small fires
that send dancing shadows across the roof of the great cave.
From some of the kivas comes the chanting of the priests; from
others come the more uncertain voices of the boys as they learn
the endless songs. Some of the groups around the fires are also
singing but most of them are quietly talking, gambling and
sleeping.</p>
<p>The canyon is lighted by the bright rays of a golden harvest
moon and the cliffs echo the voices of the singers, not only from
Cliff Palace but from all the other cliff dwellings up and down
the canyons. The great green mesa is filled with happy, thankful
people and troubles seem far away. The gods are pleased with
the efforts of the industrious Indians.</p>
<p>As autumn fades into winter the people of Cliff Palace face
it with confidence. Winter is always an ordeal but they are well-prepared.
There is an abundance of food and there is ample
clothing. Great piles of wood have been gathered and the houses
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
have carefully been rechinked. There will be suffering and
many deaths during the cold months that are ahead but spring
is just beyond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">7</span>
<br />WINTER</h2>
<p>Winter is the least enjoyable of all seasons for the people
of Cliff Palace. It is a long, quiet, cold season, when the
witches plague the people with their evil deeds. There is much
sickness and suffering and often the sadness of death hangs
over the town. Those who are active and healthy do not mind
it so much, but it is an uncomfortable season for the children
and an agonizing time for older men and women who suffer
from rheumatism and arthritis.</p>
<p>During the late fall the weather has grown colder and colder
and now in December comes true winter. Cold winds sweep
down from the mountains to the north, bringing the snow: soon
the mesa tops are white. In the vicinity of Cliff Palace it seldom
gets deep. When it reaches a depth of a foot, it is considered
heavy, but if it reaches a depth of two feet or more the
people talk excitedly about it and the old men begin to recall
the heavy snows of by-gone days. The snow will not remain on
the ground all winter for the mesa slopes to the south and the
rays of the sun beat directly down upon it. The first December
snow will soon melt and the mesa tops will be dry for a time.
Then another snow storm will turn it white again but that, too,
will melt away and so it will continue through the winter. Occasionally,
there will be warm days when the mesa tops will be
muddy and small streams of water will come trickling down
the cliffs.</p>
<p>As the cold increases the people gradually become accustomed
to it. Their houses are never perfectly warm and comfortable
so their strong, healthy bodies become hardened to the
chill of the shadowy cave. Sometimes the night temperatures
drop close to, or even below, zero. Since the cave faces west
the sun does not come in until the middle of the afternoon and
during the morning the temperature rises very little. When the
sun finally comes into the cave in the afternoon it brings a sudden
warmth and for a couple of hours the people are almost
comfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>There are old men in the town who can remember when all
of the people lived in pueblos on the mesa top and they never
stop telling about those better days. The moment the sun came
up in the morning the temperature began to rise and all through
the day it warmed the open pueblos. The old men insist the
people were happier then, the witches were less troublesome
and there was less sickness. Remembering those sunny days
the old men mutter about the depressing shadows that chill
Cliff Palace during the winter.</p>
<p>Dozens of small fires burn constantly in the cave and those
fires, in addition to the natural warmth of hundreds of closely
crowded people, dull the sharpest edge of the cold. Clothing is
the final defense and as the severity of winter increases, more
and more is worn.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth, feather blankets and buckskin robes are worn
in every conceivable manner except as actual tailored garments.
The nearest approach to tailored clothing is an occasional
slip-over buckskin jacket without sleeves. Sometimes a
robe is slit in the center and slipped, poncho-like, over the
head. Pieces of feather cloth, cotton cloth or buckskin are tied
about the body as close-fitting jackets or draped, skirt-like,
from the waist. Large, soft feather blankets and buckskin robes
are draped over the shoulders and drawn in about the body.
Short leggins are made of buckskin, or woven of human hair, to
add to the comfort of the lower legs.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, they are a raggedy-looking crowd but the
clothing does give protection against the cold. The people have
tanned buckskin in abundance, there is considerable cotton
cloth and each person has at least one feather robe. By utilizing
these in every possible way the desired effect is achieved,
even though neat tailoring is unknown.</p>
<p>Shadowy though the cave may be, it is free of wind and snow
and while complete comfort may seldom be attained, except in
the kivas, most of the people become accustomed to the chill.
But those who are naturally weak and those who are weakened
by illness or age suffer greatly from the cold of winter.</p>
<p>There is less activity than during any other season. When
the mesas are fairly clear of snow the men often go after firewood
and they always keep enough on hand to last through a
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
long period of deep snow. When the people first moved into the
cave, firewood was close at hand. The slope in front of the
cave was covered with pinon and juniper trees and the mesa top
above the cave was heavily forested. But now, after generations
of use, there are no trees left near the town and the men must
go far across the mesa top for firewood. This is a problem
that always faces the people for during the winter vast amounts
of wood are used. Sometimes villages must be deserted because
of the failure of the supply of firewood.</p>
<p>When the men bring the wood in from the mesa, they carry
it to the top of the cliff at either end of the cave. After shouting
to make sure no one is below, they hurl the logs over the
cliff to crash on the rocks below. The shattering crash saves
much chopping with stone axes and the women gather the splintered
pieces and store them in the cave.</p>
<p>Winter is a good season for hunting and when the snows are
not too deep the young men often go out in search of deer and
mountain sheep. Deep snows on the high northern rim of the
mesa have forced the animals down to the lower parts and the
men do not have far to go for their game.</p>
<p>When they are not busy gathering wood and hunting, the men
spend most of their time in the kivas. They have a decided advantage
over the women and children in this one respect for the
kivas are completely comfortable. Being entirely underground,
and with only the one small door in the roof, a kiva is kept perfectly
warm by a small fire in the central firepit. Fresh-air
comes down the ventilator shaft to drive the smoke out through
the door and the lower part of the room is never smoky. The
floor is covered with mats and skins and the men loaf, sleep
and work in perfect comfort. Unmarried boys who have been
initiated into the religious societies live in the kivas most of
the time during the winter and the married men often sleep in
them. They are far more comfortable than the houses.</p>
<p>Women and children, having few kiva privileges, are forced
to spend their time in the courts, where they huddle around the
fires, and in the houses. Few of the houses have fires inside
for in the small, unventilated rooms the smoke is almost unbearable.
Sometimes an older person prefers the discomfort
of smoke to the misery of the cold and a fire is built in a house.
A smoky, soot-blackened room results.</p>

<p>At night the women and children snuggle close together for
warmth. The floor of the house is covered with skins, blankets
and heavy mats woven of reeds, juniper bark or yucca fibers.
Sometimes deep, soft layers of corn shucks and tassels are
spread on the floor and the blankets are spread on them. The
last person into the room reaches back out through the door,
picks up the thin sandstone door slab that is leaning against the
wall, and fits it carefully into the opening. With the soft floor
coverings and plenty of warm blankets and skins the closely-snuggled
women and children spend the cold nights in comparative
comfort.</p>
<p>During the warmer seasons the people arose at dawn but
now they stay in bed until a much later hour. Actually they are
more comfortable in their beds and since there is no important
work to be done, there is no need for early rising.</p>
<p>As soon as the women stir out of their blankets, they start
the fires and when there is sufficient warmth the children crawl
out to huddle about the flames. On each fire a large jar of water
is heating and when it finally boils a special corn meal,
which was made from fresh corn at harvest time, is stirred in.
This makes a thin corn gruel and mugs of the nourishing hot
drink are passed to the waiting children. By mid-morning the
breakfast of corn bread and meat is ready and the men, most
of whom have spent the night in the kiva, join their families
around the fires. Late in the afternoon the second meal of the
day is served and it is always more elaborate; meat, corn
bread, beans, and squash in various combinations, seasoned
with dried fruits, roots and berries which were gathered in
abundance during the fall. Food is a most important factor in
the fight against the rigors of winter and the women spend long
hours around the cooking fires.</p>
<p>There is no water problem during the winter. Ice and snow
are brought in and melted and springs which have a southern
exposure continue to flow. Less water is needed than at any
other season so the women spend very little time obtaining the
necessary supplies. Most of their time is occupied with corn
grinding, cooking, and the care of the smaller children. Occasionally
a woman weaves a basket but pottery is seldom made
during the cold season. Principally, the women are occupied
with keeping their families warm and well fed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>For the men, winter is an easy time. Once in a while they
leave the cave to go hunting and wood gathering or to trot off to
another village to gamble or witness a ceremony but for the
most part they seldom stray far from their warm, comfortable
kivas. There they work leisurely at their various crafts, producing
the many things they need. Winter is a fine time for
weaving since it can be done in the kiva. Many ceremonies are
performed during the winter months, not only the regular ceremonies
which are performed at exactly the same time each
year, but countless healing ceremonies which are conducted
whenever there is sickness in the town. Winter is also a fine
time for training the boys in ceremonial ways and there is
much story-telling, singing and chanting as the boys broaden
their religious background.</p>
<p>In the early winter one important ceremony is held when the
priests &ldquo;turn back the sun.&rdquo; Every day since early summer the
sun has moved farther and farther south along the western horizon.
At last, in late December, he has reached the point beyond
which he must not be allowed to go. The priests know the
spot well: it is on the horizon directly over a certain mark on
the opposite canyon wall. When the sun reaches this spot each
year the priests perform the ceremony that causes him to
cease his southern journey and start back to the north again.
If the priests fail to please the Sun Father, or if he is angry
with the people, he will continue his journey to the south and
perpetual cold and darkness will envelope the earth. Never yet
have the priests failed; always the sun has been pleased and
after reaching that certain spot he has reversed and started
back to the north to bring the long days and the warmth of
summer.</p>
<p>When the Sun Watcher finds that the setting sun has reached
the proper spot, the Crier Chief makes the announcement and
the priests begin their ceremony. Day after day it continues
until they see that the sun has started back to the north. There
is great rejoicing in Cliff Palace: the sun has heeded the
prayers and is coming back. The happy people marvel at the
power of their priests who have never failed in this important
duty.</p>
<p>As winter progresses and the cold increases, witches become
more and more active and there is much sickness in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
town. Throughout the winter the medicine men and the medicine
societies are busy in their efforts to counteract the evil
powers of the witches who cause all serious diseases. Minor
ailments, which the people can understand, are not considered
to result from witchcraft. If a person gets a grain of sand in
his eye, if a child gets a bone caught in its throat, or if a child
has a sudden stomach-ache from overeating, it is considered
to be the natural result of something the people can see and
understand. But the serious illnesses, which strike so mysteriously,
are not natural and are considered to result from
the evil practices of witches. Only the medicine men, with
their supernatural powers, can combat the witch-caused diseases
and the medicine men and the medicine societies are
busy with their healing ceremonies. During the winter witches
always seem to be more active and as a result there is more
sickness and death than at other times. The people are often
uneasy and there is not the happiness which was so prevalent
during the other seasons. It is not simply because there is
sickness and suffering&mdash;it is more because of the fear which
is in the hearts of the people. Any person may be a witch and
usually it is impossible to tell who is causing the trouble.</p>
<p>Children suffer a great deal and all through the winter they
sniffle and cough with colds. Sometimes the colds settle in the
sinuses, in the ears or even in the lungs, bringing complications
against which the priests are powerless. Often the end
is slow in coming. When a cold settles in the middle ear and
an abscessed mastoid results, the terrible agony may last for
weeks before the inevitable result brings an end to the suffering.
Sometimes the end comes quickly and a mother hardly
realizes that her baby is sick before it is gone.</p>
<p>Many of the older people are suffering from the agony of
decayed and abscessed teeth. All their lives they have been
eating the gritty corn bread that has come from the soft grinding
stones. As a result, their teeth are badly ground away;
sometimes they are ground down to the gums. With the loss of
the tooth enamel, decay has come and now aching and abscessed
teeth are the result. Here is an old fellow with a great cavity
in each molar; half of them are throbbing with pain as the cold
air hits the exposed nerves. Here is an old man suffering the
agony of three abscessed upper teeth; at night he walks the
floor moaning with pain. This old fellow&rsquo;s lower right canine
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
tooth developed a cystoid abscess; it has eaten through his
cheek causing an ugly running sore on his face. In one house
is an old woman who long ago lost all her teeth; years of chewing
on her gums have caused them to recede until now her nose
and chin almost touch. Yonder is an old man who for months
has had an aching molar. In order to ease the pain he has been
chewing on the other side and now those teeth are so badly
ground away that they too are aching. So it is throughout the
city. Decayed, abscessed and impacted teeth, pyorrhea and
other dental ailments are common.</p>
<p>The medicine men have little success in their efforts to
combat the agony of an aching or abscessed tooth. Finally, if
the patient can no longer bear the pain, the tooth is extracted
and in this the suffering person has two choices. One method
is to knock the tooth out. One end of a piece of bone or hard
wood is placed against the base of the tooth and an obliging
neighbor taps the other end sharply with a stone axe. Instantly
the tooth is gone! The other method of extraction is equally
simple. A long, strong piece of sinew is obtained and one end
is tied securely around the aching tooth. The other end of the
sinew is tied to a large rock. Then the rock is thrown away.
And with it goes the tooth!</p>
<p>If the patient is unable to face the drastic extraction, the
tooth is simply allowed to abscess and slough away. Sometimes
an aged person loses every tooth in this manner. One
after another they abscess and slough out until at last the helpless
victim is able to relax in the blessed state of painless
toothlessness.</p>
<p>Many of the people, especially the older ones, are suffering
from rheumatism and arthritis. There are many specific causes
but often it is merely the breakdown that comes from a life of
exposure and hard work. The people age early and although
there are a few very old men and women in the town the average
life expectancy is low. Before middle age is reached many
are unable to bear their share of the work. Limbs are swollen
and stiffened with arthritis and rheumatism, and spines are
stiffened or even partially or completely solidified with arthritis.
When these conditions come, the bent and crippled oldsters
seldom venture far from the cave. They are cared for
and honored by their children and their clan relatives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>In addition to the many diseases that afflict the people, there
are often injuries. During the winter, snow and ice gather in
the toe-holds on the cliffs and climbers, becoming momentarily
careless, sometimes crash on the rocks below. Fractured
skulls, arms and legs result and their treatment gives the
priests some of their most serious problems. Compound fractures
result in fatal infections and the medicine men can do little
in the case of a serious fracture of the skull. Simple fractures
of the lower arm or leg are often treated successfully.
Thin splints of wood are bound to the limb to hold the bones in
position and after the break has healed, full use of the member
is often regained. A fracture of the upper arm or leg is seldom
treated with success for the powerful muscles pull the bones
out of the position and, if the victim survives, a crippled limb
results. Over in the north end of the town lives a young lady of
nineteen who suffered an accident of this type. Returning from
the spring one day with a heavy jar of water on her head, she
missed her step and fell over a low cliff. Her left femur was
broken just below the hip. Instead of knitting properly, the
broken ends of the bone slipped past each other and grew together
side by side, with a two inch overlap. The young lady
is able to hobble about with the aid of a crutch but her left leg
is two inches shorter than the right.</p>
<p>The medicine men wage a constant battle against the diseases
and injuries which afflict the people. Against some of
the diseases they have little success: it simply means that the
witches who are to blame are too strong. In other cases the
medicine man wins and the patient recovers. Ailments which
originate in the mind are common and are easily cured. Since
the people live in constant fear of witches, they often feel they
have been bewitched by some evil person. This causes them
to imagine strange ailments and the medicine men are called
upon to counteract the evil spell. Such ailments are easily
treated for the patient&rsquo;s faith in the medicine man and the constant
promise of a cure soon drive away the imagined troubles.</p>
<p>When a person becomes ill, a family council is held and it
is decided that a medicine man, or doctor, must be called. The
father, or some male relative, mixes a small amount of corn
meal with powdered turquoise and wraps it in a corn husk.
This he takes to the medicine man and, placing it in his hand,
tells him what is wanted. The medicine man agrees to come in
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
the evening. During the day the family prepares food, while the
doctor prays and prepares his medicines. In the evening the
doctor comes to the patient&rsquo;s home and prepares for the examination.
Smearing ashes on his hands, as protection against
witches, he removes the patient&rsquo;s clothing and feels over his
body, searching for the cause of the illness. Upon completing
his diagnosis, the doctor mixes a medicine of powdered herbs
and water and gives it to the patient to drink. Then, after assuring
the patient that he will recover, the doctor leaves.</p>
<p>If, however, the patient fails to recover and grows worse,
the entire medicine society is called in. Again, the father takes
corn meal and powdered turquoise to the medicine man and requests
that the society perform a healing ceremony. If the patient&rsquo;s
condition is critical, the doctor agrees to bring the
members of the society in the evening. If there seems to be no
immediate emergency, he agrees to bring them after four days
have passed.</p>
<p>During the four-day period, preparations are made. The
priests pray and get their ceremonial equipment ready and each
morning, in order to cleanse themselves, drink emetics that
cause them to vomit. The family of the sick person prepares
great quantities of food so the priests may be fed and all members
of the family cleanse themselves by vomiting each morning.
If the emetic does not cause vomiting, a long feather is
thrust down the person&rsquo;s throat until the desired result is obtained.</p>
<p>On the evening of the fourth day the patient is taken into the
kiva of the medicine society. Two men, armed with bows and
arrows, are stationed outside the kiva to keep witches away.
On the kiva floor the priests have made a small painting by using
corn meal of different colors and around the painting are
prayersticks, fetishes of the curing animals, rattles, eagle
feathers, bags of herb medicines and other ceremonial equipment.
Upon entering the kiva, the patient sits down or, if he is
very ill, lies down in front of the meal-painting.</p>
<p>The doctors, faces painted and wearing only their loincloths,
are seated behind the painting. They are singing and the songs,
which continue for some time, are an effort to induce the spirits
of the curing animals, the mountain lion, bear, badger, wolf,
eagle and shrew to enter the kiva. These animals have great
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
supernatural healing powers and their spirits must be present
in the kiva. As the singing continues, two doctors step out and
do a short dance, then another doctor comes forward to prepare
the medicine. Stirring some of the powdered herbs into
a bowl of water, he ladles it out to the patient and all other persons
in the kiva.</p>
<p>Now it is time for the most important part of the ceremony:
they must find the object which is causing the disease. One of
the doctors rubs ashes on his hands and begins to search the
patient&rsquo;s body for the object which a witch has shot into it.
After careful search, he locates the object and sucks it out of
the patient&rsquo;s body. Spitting the object into his hand, he shows
it to everyone. It is a centipede!</p>
<p>The doctors have also found that the patient&rsquo;s heart has been
stolen by witches and now they must get it back. Two of the
doctors smear themselves with ashes and, with stone knives in
their hands, climb out of the kiva. Soon the people hear sounds
of fighting down on the trash pile in front of the cave. There
are loud cries and the sounds of struggling, and blows being
struck. Then all is quiet and other doctors go out to bring the
two back. One of the doctors is unconscious and must be carried
into the kiva and both show the marks of a furious struggle.
But they have recovered the patient&rsquo;s heart&mdash;it is a little
ball of rags. When the ball is cut open, a grain of corn is found
in the center and this is given to the patient to swallow. Now
that he has recovered his heart he will soon be well.</p>
<p>The ceremony is over and as the patient returns to his home
the doctors put away their ceremonial equipment. Soon the
women of the patient&rsquo;s family bring food which they have prepared
and the medicine men have a fine feast. Baskets of corn meal
are also brought to the medicine men in payment for the
cure which they have effected.</p>
<p>At any time of the year there may be sickness in Cliff Palace
but there is always the greatest amount in the winter. Seldom
during the cold season are the people entirely free from
it. The medicine men carry out the prescribed ceremonies,
sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing. When they effect a
cure there is rejoicing but when they fail there is sadness in
the city and the relatives of the unfortunate person are plunged
into mourning.</p>

<p class="pcap">Bodies were usually buried in a folded position</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Very soon after death comes preparations are made for the
burial. The body is bathed and the hair is washed. The arms
are folded across the chest and tied together to hold them in
position. The legs are folded up against the body. Around the
tightly-flexed body is wrapped a cotton blanket, then a large
feather blanket. Finally the bundle is wrapped in a piece of
matting and is ready for burial.</p>
<p>There is no cemetery and the burial may be made anywhere.
When the weather is good the bodies may be buried out on the
mesa top or anywhere in the canyon. Sometimes they are
placed in crevices in the cliffs or in holes under large boulders.
During the winter, when the ground is frozen and covered
with snow, graves are often dug in the great trash pile in
front of the cave. For generations the people have dumped
their ashes and refuse there and it is not difficult to dig a grave
in the soft, ashy material.</p>
<p>Occasionally death comes when a severe storm is raging
outside the cave. Rather than face the storm the men of a burial
party sometimes seal a body in an empty house or bury it
in the trash room in the rear of the cave. The cave roof is too
low for houses in that space so the long, low room is used as a
trash room and turkey roost. When a body is buried there it
is surrounded by perfectly dry materials such as ashes, dust,
corn cobs, corn tassels and turkey droppings. The chill of
winter prevents decay and the body begins to dry out. Soon all
moisture is gone and only the bones and dried tissues remain.
If no moisture reaches it, the dry, mummy-like body will remain
unchanged for centuries.</p>
<p>After the grave is dug the tightly-wrapped body is placed
in it. Food and water are placed in the grave, along with the
personal possessions of the deceased; weapons, tools, jewelry
and other articles which the spirit of the dead person will need
in the afterworld. After the grave is filled with earth and rocks
the members of the burial party return to their homes and
purify themselves by washing their hair, vomiting and fumigating
their clothing in smoke.</p>
<p>The spirit of the deceased does not leave the body for four
days so each morning relatives place food and water on the
grave. At sunrise on the fourth morning the spirit leaves the
body and journeys back through Sipapu, into the Mother Earth,
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
where the dead live in another world much like this one. As
soon as the spirit is gone the relatives purify themselves and
from this time on try not to speak of, or think of the dead person
again. Grieving may cause sickness so the dead are best
forgotten.</p>
<p>The winter passes slowly. For those who are strong and
active it has no terrors although it may cause a certain amount
of discomfort. For those who are weak and sick it becomes an
ordeal. At no time during the winter is Cliff Palace free from
sickness and suffering and the spirits of the people are often
low. In January the cold becomes more intense. Scores of
fires burn brightly in the great cave as the people attempt to
drive out the cold. Some nights the temperature falls very
close to zero. High overhead hangs a brilliant white moon and
the snowy canyon is almost as light as day. From the cliff near
the great ceremonial building comes the wail of a coyote: from
the mesa top comes the mournful hoot of an owl. The cave is
quiet except for low chanting in some of the kivas and the snoring
of old men. Sometimes a baby whimpers or a sick person
groans. Now and then a muffled scream echoes through the
cave as an aged sufferer cries out from the agony of arthritis
or an abscessed tooth.</p>
<p>There is little travel during the coldest periods. The men
forego their hunting and visiting and everyone stays close to
the sheltering cave with the single idea of keeping warm and
well. The city is quieter now: there is none of the boisterous
gaiety that was so pronounced during the other seasons.</p>
<p>The men spend most of their time in the kivas while the
women and children gather around the fires in the courtyards.
The turkeys roost in the back of the cave at night and come out
in the daytime to wander about the courts and roof-tops and
fight with the dogs for scraps of food that are thrown to them.
During periods when there is deep snow in the canyon, the turkeys
are fed small amounts of the precious corn but in late
winter they grow thin and bedraggled. When they are not roaming
about the city searching for food they sit in quiet rows on
the housetops, feathers fluffed against the cold. The turkeys
are highly prized, both for their meat and for their feathers,
but they lead a miserable existence. They do not thrive in the
cold shadowy cave and the flocks usually are not large. Not
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
only are they tormented by children and dogs but regularly they
suffer the indignity of having their feathers plucked for use in
ceremonies and in the manufacture of feather blankets.</p>
<p>As the end of winter draws near the food becomes more
monotonous. Many of the tastier foods are gone: the supplies
of pinon nuts, dried fruits, roots, squash and dried berries are
completely exhausted. Now each meal consists of meat, corn
bread and beans. Sometimes the meat is fresh but usually it is
meat that was dried last fall. This meat is as hard as rawhide
and must be pounded with stones and thoroughly cooked before
it can be eaten. In order to gain variety the women bake the
corn bread in every possible way and corn meal, meat and
beans are combined in numerous forms. Still the food is monotonous
and everyone longs for something green.</p>
<p>In February the snows become heavy and wet and in the latter
part of the month there is rain. Even though the rain does
not come into the cave everything becomes damp. The days
are getting warmer now and as a result a foul odor hangs over
the city.</p>
<p>At any time of the year a strong odor of decaying animal
and vegetable matter and human offal fills the cave. Out in
front is the great trash pile and in the rear is the trash room
where the turkeys roost and where some of the dead are buried.
In addition to this, the people have no idea of personal sanitation.
In the warmer seasons they usually step outside the cave
but in the winter they merely step back into the turkey roost or
out on the front terraces.</p>
<p>Because of this there is always a heavy odor about the city.
In the summer it is not so bad for the women often sweep out
the houses and courts and throw the trash out in front of the
cave where the hot sun drys out the waste materials. In the
winter there is less of this cleaning and the trash and filth accumulate.
The dampness in the air causes mould and mustiness
and when the warm wet days of late winter come the air
is foul with the odor of decaying matter.</p>
<p>The people do not notice this odor. Their first breath of
life was like that and they merely think it is the way air smells.</p>
<p>As the end of winter draws near the cold grows less intense.
There are still occasional snowstorms but they are warm and
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
wet and melt rapidly. The mesas are soggy with mud and small
streams of water trickle over the cliffs as the snow disappears.
The air is warm and balmy: during the middle of the day it is
often hot. Grass turns green in the sheltered spots and the
buds on the shrubs begin to swell. Chipmunks and squirrels
come out of hibernation to greet the spring.</p>
<p>The people of Cliff Palace have been noting all of these signs
and there is a stir of activity in the city as they throw off the
cloak of winter. It was this promise of spring that helped them
through. Sometimes they have been cold and there has been sickness
and death. At times there has been a heavy pall of sadness
over the city. Now all that is over for spring is in the air.</p>
<p>The people are happy and smiling as they bustle about preparing
for the work that is ahead. The men think of their
farms, the women think of making pottery, repairing and building
houses, and arranging marriages. The children, turkeys
and dogs think of nothing: they merely dash out of the shadowy
cave into the warm spring sunshine.</p>
<p>Our year with the people of Cliff Palace has ended. Spring,
summer, autumn and winter have passed. Now spring has arrived
to start the eternal cycle all over again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">8</span>
<br />THE END OF THE STORY</h2>
<p>The year we have just spent with the people of Cliff Palace
was a normal year for all of the people of the Mesa Verde. We
have seen the daily events in one cliff dwelling and we may feel
sure that similar events were taking place in each of the many
hundreds of cliff dwellings on the great mesa.</p>
<p>There was not a single occurrence that made it any different
from the countless other normal years they experienced.
It did not remain long in their memories for it was just one
more year when all of the forces of nature worked in perfect
harmony. There was an abundance of snow and rain, and food
was plentiful. There were no catastrophes or memorable
events.</p>
<p>Good years, such as that one, were soon forgotten. The
years they remembered were those that brought sadness or
disaster. Talkative old men long remembered the years of
terrific drouth or the year the crops were destroyed by forest
fires. They did not soon forget the evil summer when almost
all of the babies died of a strange malady, and for centuries the
storytellers recalled the year when a monster swallowed the
sun completely for a few minutes. Those were the unusual
years and they served as mile posts. Time was measured from
them.</p>
<p>The years of catastrophe did not come often. It was only
occasionally that the crops failed and when they did the people
were prepared for it. A thousand years of farming in the Mesa
Verde had taught them that every few years they must expect a
dry year without a harvest. Often they were able to predict
such a season in advance. If the heavy snows of December and
January and February failed to come, the men began to worry.
Then if the spring rains failed to come, the farmers became
quite sure that the harvests would be poor. Months in advance
they began to prepare for the lean year that faced them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Food was measured out sparingly: not a grain of corn or a
pinch of meal was wasted. The women searched endlessly for
wild plant foods and the men went hunting day after day. By
living more on meat and wild plants they were able to conserve
the stores of corn and beans. Water supplies were built up and
they tried to enter the summer season with every available drop
stored in their jars and in the pools in the canyon. New springs
were developed and in extreme cases the women even walked
four miles down the canyon to the Mancos River for water.</p>
<p>By skillfully adjusting themselves to conditions the people
were able to survive a year of drouth with little difficulty. A
second year of crop failure was very serious but still it could
be managed and occasionally during their occupancy of the
Mesa Verde they had even survived periods of drouth that lasted
several years. Such an ordeal brought suffering and hardship:
it meant death for many of the weaker people. But still it could
be endured.</p>
<p>So it was that when drouth settled down upon the Mesa Verde
in the year 1276 A.D., the people thought nothing of it. They
had just enjoyed several good years and they worried little
when the crops failed. They took the usual precautions and the
priests assured them that the next year would be normal again.
But the drouth did not break. Year after year it continued. A
generation passed and still the drouth did not end.</p>
<p>The rings of trees which grew at that time show that the
drouth continued for twenty-four years. From 1276, through
1299, rainfall was below normal in the Mesa Verde and surrounding
regions. Many of the years were unbelievably dry.
Some were only moderately dry and a few were almost normal.
But throughout the long period, rainfall was far below average.
Winter snows were light and failed to restore the soil moisture.
Summer rains were often completely lacking. Each year the
soil lost more of its moisture and only the hardiest plants were
able to survive. During the entire period there probably was
not a harvest worthy of the name.</p>
<p>The drouth was the worst ever known in the Southwest and
its effect on the people of the Mesa Verde was tragic. Year
after year the crops withered in the fields. Wild food plants
also died or failed to reproduce. The larger game animals
drifted off to the mountains and the smaller animals diminished
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
in numbers. In their search for food the women scoured the
mesas until there was not an edible plant left. The men hunted
far and wide with less and less luck. Still the drouth continued.
Water supplies dwindled. During the winter the pools in the
canyon failed to fill and the lack of moisture caused the springs
to become mere trickles. It was impossible to wring water
from the earth when no water was there.</p>
<p>The people were faced with three terrors; the lack of food,
the lack of water, and the wrath of the gods. The first two actually
existed; the last existed only in their minds. Consequently,
it was the worst of all. Added to their tragic need of
food and water was the horrible fear that their gods had deserted
them.</p>
<p>How the priests must have labored. Every ceremony, every
trick they knew was repeated time after time as the drouth progressed.
The cliff dwellings echoed with the chants and Sun
Temple, the great ceremonial building, must have been the
scene of countless super-ceremonials as the priests of the
various villages threw their combined strength into the fight.</p>
<p>Still the drouth continued!</p>
<p>Throughout the Mesa Verde there was much death from
starvation and disease. Food and water were practically exhausted.
The tragic moment came when they were forced to
eat the seed corn. This was the last resort: it could be fatal
to farmers. Only when death faced them did they sacrifice the
precious seed for there could never be another crop unless they
were fortunate enough to find other people with surplus supplies.
The result was inevitable. Since the drouth would not
end the people could only drift away, hoping to find better conditions
elsewhere. It was their only chance of survival.</p>
<p>The migration from the Mesa Verde must have taken place
gradually. As a matter of fact, there are indications that the
migrations began even before the drouth came. At an earlier
date vast areas around the Mesa Verde were occupied by members
of the same tribe. Some time before 1200 A.D., however,
the population began to dwindle and by the time the drouth came
almost all of the area, except the Mesa Verde, was deserted.</p>
<p>In all probability, these early migrations were caused by
pressure from an enemy tribe for there is much to indicate that
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
the people were in trouble. Certainly the population was dwindling
long before the great drouth began. The identity of the
enemy is not definitely known. It has been suggested that the
Apaches may have entered the region at that time, or possibly
the early Utes. No definite evidence of the enemy people has
been found but their pressure is indicated by their effect upon
the peaceful farming Indians.</p>
<p>The migration from the Mesa Verde probably took place
gradually; certainly there was no mass movement. As the
drouth continued small groups drifted off in search of better
conditions. All of the people of a small village may have moved
together but the larger towns must have broken up gradually.
Cliff Palace and other large cliff dwellings probably were deserted
a clan at a time. As conditions became more desperate
the people quarreled over the dwindling supplies. There must
have been many cases of actual violence as frenzied men sought
to obtain food and water for their starving families. Dissatisfaction
and discontent mounted rapidly and the once happy towns
were abandoned by their people as clan after clan took to the
trail in search of new homes.</p>
<p>Before the twenty-four year drouth was over, the Mesa
Verde was entirely deserted and there is no evidence that any
of the people ever returned. Since that tragic time the cliff
dwellings have been empty and silent as they have fought against
the heavy, leveling hand of time.</p>
<p>When the people left the Mesa Verde their troubles were not
over. The drouth was felt all over the Southwest and life was
possible only in the most favorable spots. Added to the misfortunes
of the drifting people was the increased activity of the
nomadic Indians for they, too, suffered from the drouth. It is
possible that their increased activities hastened the flight from
the Mesa Verde for they must have preyed upon the farming
peoples during the troubled times.</p>
<p>Although large numbers perished before and during the migration,
many of the Mesa Verde Indians did survive. The major
migration seems to have been to the southeast and finally
the people settled in the Rio Grande Valley. One group crossed
the river and for a time lived in the Gallisteo Basin, a short
distance southeast of the present city of Santa Fe, New Mexico.
After a time this area was deserted and the people mingled
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
with other Pueblo Indians along the Rio Grande. As they merged
with the others they gradually lost their identity as Mesa Verde
people.</p>
<p>During the great drouth the population of the Southwest was
diminished and many regions were abandoned forever by the
Pueblo Indians. When the drouth finally ended the survivors
were concentrated in the most favorable spots where there were
the best supplies of water, the finest farming lands or good
natural defenses against the nomadic Indians.</p>
<p>In some regions they prospered for a time but never again
did they reach the high level they had attained before the great
drouth. Perhaps the drouth caused a dry rot to set in and the
fortunes of the Pueblo people waned. When Coronado came
there were less than eighty pueblos: today there are less than
thirty.</p>
<p>The people of these present-day pueblos are the descendants
of scores of thousands of Pueblo Indians who once lived in
the Southwest. In their veins, greatly thinned by the centuries,
flows the blood of the ancient people of the Mesa Verde.</p>

<br />ORIGIN OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN</h2>
<p>The story of the Mesa Verde really had its beginning many
thousands of years ago in a distant land. It began when the first
ancient Asiatic stepped across from Siberia and became the
First American. Who he was and exactly when it happened we
shall never know, but it was the important first step in a long
chain of events which led to the occupation of the Mesa Verde
by Pueblo Indians.</p>
<p>There seems to be little doubt that the early inhabitants of
North and South America came from Asia by that northern route.
It is the only route by which men, traveling without artificial
means of transportation, could have reached these western continents.
Not a single insurmountable barrier, not a single impossibility
lay in the path of those ancient men as they drifted
with the line of least resistance. From the northwest, America
was discovered and populated.</p>
<p>Men first came into being somewhere in the Old World. From
this point of beginning they spread slowly over the face of the
earth. In all directions the ancient men traveled, always on foot,
always without a goal. After a time Europe, Africa and Asia were
populated, but the Americas remained without men. Surrounded
by vast areas of water, except at one point, the Americas were
the last great land bodies to be discovered.</p>
<p>Finally, the day of discovery arrived. For countless centuries
groups of men had been drifting over the great continent of
Asia. Farther and farther they traveled until at last a group,
perhaps forced on by stronger groups behind, stood on the utmost
tip of northeastern Asia, the tip of Siberia now known as the East
Cape.</p>
<p>Standing on the ocean shore those men shaded their eyes and
looked out across the water. There, only fifty-six miles away,
lay another land. Curiosity, or perhaps the force of &ldquo;enemy
pressure&rdquo;, urged them on. A means of crossing those fifty-six
tantalizing miles was found. At last the first human foot touched
American soil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>At first glance it may seem that the crossing would be impossible
for men who were without boats. Such was not the case. In
winter the Bering Sea often freezes over completely. Present-day
Eskimos cross on the ice and only a few years ago a white
man made the crossing with a dog team. Thus, primitive man
needed only the winter ice in order to satisfy his curiosity about
the land across the water. The journey was made even less
hazardous by two islands, the Diomedes, that raised their heads
in the center of the Bering Sea, cutting the crossing into two
shorter jumps.</p>
<p>It is even possible that when those men reached that tip of
Asia no water separated them from America. A strip of land
may have connected the two continents. It is known very definitely
that at some not far distant date the two continents were
connected by land, for some of our well-known animals have
crossed from one to the other. The horse and the camel developed
in America and walked off to Asia. The mammoth and
the bison reversed the direction and crossed from Asia to America.
In order for those beasts to make the crossing, a land
bridge was necessary.</p>
<p>When the land bridge disappeared is not known. When the
first men came is not known. Certain it is, however, that if the
land bridge was in existence when the first men came to America,
it afforded them an easy approach. If, on the other hand,
it had disappeared beneath the waves of the Bering Sea, the men
must have crossed on the ice. No one can as yet be positive as
to the exact manner of the crossing. The important point is that
the crossing was made and America was discovered and populated.
Primitive man, after hundreds of thousands of years of
wandering over the Old World, had at last found the one point at
which he could enter a new land.</p>
<p>That this new land was superior to the old soon became apparent
to the newcomers. Summers were longer: winters were
less severe. Hunting and fishing were excellent and in the summer
edible plants were common. Truly, here was a better land.</p>
<p>The first crossing from Asia to America was made many
thousands of years ago. From the evidence now at hand, fifteen
or twenty thousand years seems to be not too great an antiquity
for those first Americans. Even at that early date, however,
man was well-developed mentally and physically and had all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
capabilities of modern man. The first American was no primitive
brute. He was Homo sapiens, little different from the fifteenth
century foreigners who rediscovered America thousands
of years later and gradually edged it away from its first settlers.</p>
<p>Primitive human remains, such as those which have been
found in the Old World, have never been found in America. Man
went through his developmental stages in the Old World and came
to America at a late date, a fully developed human being. Pithecanthropus
erectus, Sinanthropus, Homo neanderthalensis&mdash;America
has never known those tongue-twisting lowbrows!</p>
<p>After the first discovery of the new land there were innumerable
rediscoveries. One group of men after another came to
America and those migrations continued for thousands of years.
The latest migrants came to America very recently. Thus,
America was populated by many successive waves of migration
over a long period of time.</p>
<p>It seems, almost, that after the first group came, word may
have spread from one small tribe to another that off to the east
lay a better land. People were disappearing over the eastern
horizon. What lay in that direction? Curiosity urged them on!</p>
<p>It is altogether possible that actual word of the new land in
the east went back to the Asiatic continent. Perhaps there were
small counter migrations or perhaps some small traveling
group, feeling a bond with some other group in the old country,
sent runners back to beckon them on.</p>
<p>Certain it is that there was not just a single migration. Numerous
groups of men filtered into America over a period of
thousands of years. Slowly, aimlessly, they wandered. One
group pushed another and was in turn pushed by an oncoming
tribe. After a time, North and South America were covered with
hundreds of small tribes of Indians.</p>
<p>The members of these various tribes were not all alike. They
differed greatly in appearance, in language, in religion and in
mode of living. The answer is apparent. The various groups
came from different parts of Asia. They came at different times.
They settled in different parts of the New World and developed
in different ways according to the natural resources in each
region. As a result there came into being the many tribes of
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
American Indians which were in America when Columbus came
on his journey of rediscovery from the east.</p>
<p>The early part of the story of the Americas is still hazy. In
spite of many years of search by dozens of top-flight archeologists
there are many unanswered questions. Each year expeditions
sift through the dust of the ages on the trail of those early
Americans. More often than not the trail leads to a blank wall.
The ancient past of the Indian is clouded with uncertainty but
the lure of the unknown still beckons to those who are endeavoring
to trail him back to his Asiatic birthplace.</p>
<p>The great trouble is that for thousands of years the Indians
lived a hunting life. They wandered from day to day, living on
the natural foods they found in each day&rsquo;s journey. There was
no permanent home, no settled life. The hunter was ever on the
trail of his next meal.</p>
<p>Consider the life of the primitive hunter. Each morning he
is awakened by the pangs of hunger in his empty, flapping paunch
and he views with dismay his breakfast which is disappearing
over the horizon on four strong, swift legs. Rubbing the sleep
from his eyes he starts out in pursuit of his breakfast. Failing
to catch up with it, he starts after his lunch. If it eludes him,
he begins to work on the next meal&mdash;and the next and the next.
Always he is one jump behind his food supply. When he makes
a kill he gorges and smoothes the wrinkles out of his belly. When
he fails, he goes hungry.</p>
<p>Being forced to follow the game he is ever on the move. He
can have no permanent home, no pottery, nothing that cannot
easily be transported on the trail. One night he sleeps under a
tree and leaves behind a broken stone knife. The next night he
sleeps in a cave ten miles away and discards a worn-out sandal.
The third night he builds his campfire beside a lake across the
mountain. On and on through the days he moves and finally, when
the end comes, the animals of the wild clean and scatter his
bones and they return to the dust from whence they came.</p>
<p>The archeologist may find the stone knife and the discarded
sandal. He may even find the long-cold ashes of the campfire.
But there is nothing to indicate that all three belonged to the
same man. There is not a single bit of evidence that ties them
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Thus it is with the hunter. His trail is cold: the clews are
few. He is the will-o-the-wisp of the human race. He has put
many gray hairs in the head of the archeologist.</p>
<p>All of the early inhabitants of North and South America lived
a wandering, hunting life. For thousands of years they lived on
the chance products, animal and plant, that nature offered. They
seldom stayed long in one place: they never built a permanent
thing. To date the story of the first ten or fifteen thousand years
is far from complete. It can be summed up in a few words.</p>
<p>The men themselves have, for the most part, eluded us. The
fact that they lived a wandering life and seldom, if ever, buried
the dead, has made it difficult to find the bones of the men themselves.
However, the tools and weapons made and used by those
men have been found in great numbers. And best of all, they
have been found in situations which clearly indicate the antiquity
of man in America.</p>
<p>A few thousand years ago there were elephants in America.
The mammoth was here as well as his terrifying near-relative,
the mastodon. There were horses in various parts of the country
and a strange, lumbering animal, the ground sloth, was common.
Tremendous bison with long sweeping horns wallowed in the bogs
and camels roamed the plains.</p>
<p>Modern man has never seen those animals in America. They
were gone long before he came. They had been extinct thousands
of years before the first Europeans poked their tardy noses into
the New World.</p>
<p>In spite of this we know that the early Indians did see them.
They hunted them and lived on their flesh. They may have been
a contributing factor in the extinction of some of those ancient
species. Changing weather conditions thinned out the great herds
and man, not yet conservation conscious, may have helped to
wipe out the survivors.</p>
<p>How do we know?</p>
<p>In a number of places the implements of those early men have
been found in direct association with the bones of the extinct animals.
The inference is unquestionable. Dart points, knives,
scrapers and other implements have been found so definitely
associated with the bones of animals that there can be no doubt
that man and the animals existed at the same time. If those
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
animals have been extinct for thousands of years it dates the
earliest men fairly well.</p>
<p>One of the most important finds was made in northeastern
New Mexico, near the little town of Folsom. This find was important
because it was here for the first time that modern scientists
were forced to admit that man had been in America a long,
long time. It is also important because it has given a name to
some of the ancient men. Folsom Man, the most elusive American
we have yet been unable to find.</p>
<p>The discovery of the earliest evidences of Folsom Man is
one of the strangest stories in American archeology. The events
in the story covered a period of twenty-five years and it was
only by chance that the important archeological evidence came
to the attention of the scientific world.</p>
<p>Back about 1900, a negro cowboy known as Nigger George,
was riding the range on the Crowfoot Ranch near the little town
of Folsom, New Mexico, searching for cattle. As George rode
along, he came to a deep arroyo so he turned his horse and rode
along its bank. Suddenly, in the opposite wall of the arroyo, the
cowboy noticed some huge bones. They were larger than any
bones he had ever seen and the fact that they were washing out
of the arroyo wall several feet below the surface was puzzling.
Fortunately George, although an illiterate man, was curious about
the bones and, instead of riding on and forgetting them,
collected a number and took them to the ranch house.</p>
<p>The bones were obviously larger than those of modern bison
or cattle but no one at the ranch was particularly interested in
them. Many years passed and finally someone became mildly
interested in the bones and gave them to Mr. Ed Price, of Raton,
New Mexico. Again the years passed and it was not until 1925
that the bones once more attracted attention. In that year a number
were sent to the Colorado Museum of Natural History and
the paleontologists recognized them for what they were&mdash;the
bones of an extinct bison. Thousands of years ago the bison had
roamed the plains of North America. They were tremendous,
long-horned animals, larger than our present-day bison.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>In order to obtain some of the ancient skeletons the museum
sent expeditions to Folsom, New Mexico, and during three summers
the men dug the great bones out of the arroyo bank. When
the digging was finished, the men had recovered thirty skeletons
of the long-extinct bison. But in addition, they had found something
far more important. Among the bison bones they had discovered
nineteen beautiful dart, or spear points. The points
were so closely associated with the bones that there could be no
doubt as to their antiquity. And, with equal certainty, there
could be no doubt that ancient hunters had killed the great bison.</p>
<p>All evidence indicated that a few thousand years ago this was
a swampy, boggy place, a bison wallow. Primitive hunters crept
up on the drowsing animals and sometimes made a kill. They
skinned the bison, cut off what meat they wanted and left the
carcasses to rot in the mud. Sometimes they failed to extract
all of their dart points from the bodies of the bison. As the
centuries passed the bones became deeply covered with earth
and there they remained until that fateful day when Nigger George
rode by.</p>
<p>Geologists who studied the Folsom Site felt that the bison
bones had been there in the earth at least twelve or fifteen thousand
years. The importance of the nineteen dart points was immediately
evident. Since they had caused the death of the bison
there could be no doubt that men were in the area twelve or fifteen
thousand years ago. Before the Folsom discovery archeologists
had felt that men had been in America only a short time.
Now they were forced to revise their thinking concerning the
antiquity of the American Indian.</p>
<p>When the Folsom discovery was announced many archeologists
began searching for evidences of Folsom Man and a burning
question was always in their minds. Who would have the
honor of finding Folsom Man himself? After twenty-five years
of searching, the question is still unanswered. Folsom Man still
evades his trackers for no skeletons have been found which can
be considered, without doubt, to have belonged to him.</p>
<p>Evidences are plentiful for in many parts of the United States
the points have been found. But Folsom Man himself still eludes
us. The name means little. It is a term that is rather loosely
applied to the makers of the beautiful Folsom Points. They are
entirely distinctive and are among the highest examples of the
flint workers art that have been found in America. Beautifully
shaped, delicately chipped points with grooved faces, they can
not be confused with any other dart or spear points. They have
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
been found in many places, often associated with the bones of
extinct animals.</p>
<p>Up in northern Colorado, near the town of Fort Collins, is
the Lindenmeier Site. In it were found the bones of the same
bison as those of Folsom. With them were the same Folsom
Points. With them, also, were stone knives, scrapers, chopping
and rubbing stones, as well as the ashes and charcoal from ancient
campfires. They were spread over a large area. It was a campsite
where Folsom Man actually had lived. Was Folsom Man in
camp? No, he had stepped out!</p>
<p>In Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and other states, similar
finds have been made. Folsom Points, and other points
equally ancient, have been found in association with the bones of
many extinct animals such as the bison, horse, mammoth and
camel. Everywhere are found the evidences; nowhere is found
Folsom Man himself.</p>
<p>Bones of the extinct animals, being solid and massive, have
lasted well. Tools made of stone last indefinitely. Human bones,
being thin and delicate, disintegrate more rapidly. There were
probably few burials in those days and the human bones were
scattered to the four winds. Still the search goes on. Sooner
or later the find will be made. In the back of a dry cave somewhere
in the Southwest, probably, will be found some human
bones. With them will be some Folsom Points. Then we will
know that the points and the bones belonged to the same man&mdash;Folsom
Man.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, when the human bones are found, a Folsom Point
will actually be sticking in one of them. Then we will be sure
that we have Folsom Man or, at least, someone whom Folsom
Man did not like.</p>
<p>Although the actual physical remains of Folsom Man have
not been found, a human skeleton, seemingly equally ancient,
has recently been discovered. In 1947, scientists began excavating
in a dry lake bed near Mexico City because of reports
that natives had been finding mammoth bones in the area. Near
the point where the mammoth bones had been found was discovered
the partial skeleton of a man. The men who made the discovery
were very sure the skeleton was as old as the layer of
earth in which it was found, and this age was estimated to be
15,000 years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Some scientists have been skeptical about the age of this
skeleton, known as Tepexpan Man, feeling that it may represent
a more recent burial. Recently, however, another discovery has
been made which adds strength to the belief that Tepexpan Man
is ancient. Early in 1952, the skeleton of a mammoth was found
only a mile from the place where the human skeleton had been
discovered. With the mammoth bones were found six man-made
stone implements. One of these, a spear or dart point, was between
two ribs of the mammoth&mdash;in all probability the animal
had been killed by man. Even more important, however, was
the fact that the human skeleton and the mammoth skeleton were
found in the same layer of earth.</p>
<p>The importance of these two discoveries is obvious. The
mammoth skeleton and the accompanying man-made implements
indicate that man and mammoth lived in the area at the same
time. The fact that the human and mammoth skeletons were
found in the same layer of earth indicates that they may be equally
ancient, and geologists feel that layer of earth was deposited
about 15,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Thus, Tepexpan Man, unless grave errors were made during
excavation, may well be the oldest human skeleton yet found in
America. And the important point is that there was nothing primitive
about this ancient man. He was a fully developed human
being&mdash;Homo sapiens. In appearance he was much like men
of today and his brain was almost as large as that of the average
modern man.</p>
<p>The search for America&rsquo;s earliest inhabitants continues year
after year. During the past twenty-five years many finds have
been made but little has been learned about the people themselves.
In each case, when an important find is made, it consists of
spear points, dart points or other stone implements associated
with the bones of extinct animals.</p>
<p>The Folsom Points, because of the importance of the original
discovery, have received the greatest amount of publicity, but
dart or spear points of many types have been found. Usually
these projectile points are named because of the place where
they are discovered and as a result there are Scottsbluff Points,
Eden Points, Plainview Points, Sandia Points, and many more.
The great need, at the present time, is for skeletal remains of
the early men themselves. Some ancient human remains have
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
been found but scientists are not in complete agreement as to
their age. Even the Tepexpan skeleton, which may be the most
important of all, has not been accepted by all of the men who
are working on the problem of early man in America.</p>
<p>The story is being carried farther and farther into the past
by stronger and stronger evidences. No one knows where it will
end. Certain it is that America was discovered a great many
thousands of years ago. Columbus was a late comer and he came
the hard way. The real discoverers of America came the easy
way: they just walked over.</p>
<p>All of the early inhabitants of America lived by hunting and
fishing and by gathering the fruits, nuts, roots, berries and seeds
which nature offered. Since they lived a roaming, drifting life,
they built no permanent structures and as a result, their remains
are not easily found. Because of this there are many question
marks in the early part of the story and much is yet to be learned
about the earliest inhabitants of the Americas.</p>
<p>As long as the early Indians lived a wandering, hunting life
there was no real progress and we must come down to comparatively
recent times in order to appreciate the greatest accomplishments
of the American Indian. A short time ago, only
a few thousand years at most, a very important thing happened.
Somewhere in Mexico or Central America, perhaps in South
America, the first farmers appeared. Some ancient Burbank
produced corn, the plant which was responsible for all of the
highest Indian cultures which the white man found when he blundered
into America.</p>
<p>The origin of corn is still a mystery. For many years botanists
have tried to trace it back to its wild plant ancestors but
the entire story is still not known. Corn has moved so far and
has changed so radically that there are gaps in the story and we
may never know exactly how the Indians developed it. Certainly
it was the most important food plant the Indians ever knew and
because of it the lives of many Indians underwent a radical change.</p>
<p>Corn spread from one tribe to the next. One group after
another found that farming was more dependable than hunting.
Farther and farther it spread until large portions of North and
South America were covered with farming Indians. With corn
went other food plants which the Indians developed; beans, squash,
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
potatoes, tomatoes, and many more. Farming was in America
to stay.</p>
<p>The result was amazing. Many Indians who formerly had
followed the forest trails year after year now began to live settled
lives. With dependable supplies of food coming from each
harvest it was no longer necessary to move about. Permanent
habitations soon appeared and villages and towns developed. The
population increased and people began to concentrate in the best
farming areas. With all this came new inventions which led the
people always to higher stages of development.</p>
<p>When the white man finally arrived in 1492, there were fifteen
or twenty million Indians in North and South America. Some
still lived by hunting, some by fishing, others by gathering the
seeds, roots and other plant products offered by nature. But
millions of the Indians were highly developed agricultural people.
The Pueblo Indians of the Southwest, the Indians of the New England
states whom our first colonists met, the Mayas and Aztecs
of Mexico, the Incas of South America, and many others had made
surprising progress in a comparatively short time.</p>
<p>Credit for this progress goes to the amazing plant, corn, the
American Indian&rsquo;s greatest single contribution to modern man.</p>

<br />ARCHEOLOGY OF THE MESA VERDE</h2>
<p>A little while ago we spent a year with the people of Cliff
Palace and we saw them at the peak of their development as far
as the Mesa Verde was concerned. They were successful farmers,
their arts and crafts were highly developed and their religious
and social customs were rigid and complex. Obviously
the people could not have achieved such a high cultural level
in a short time: surely there must have been a long period of
development in order for them to reach the stage we saw at
Cliff Palace.</p>
<p>Actually this development extended over many centuries
and we shall now take a little time to consider the events of that
long period. This is the dry part of the story. When we saw the
people in Cliff Palace they were warm, living beings, experiencing
all the emotions any people may have. But now there
will be no flesh on the bones and we shall deal only with the
dead, rather dry facts archeologists dig out of the earth. So
we shall not tarry too long.</p>
<p>About 2000 years ago farming Indians moved into the Mesa
Verde region. The exact date is still unknown but it appears
they were well established in some parts of the area by the beginning
of the Christian Era. Even at that early date they were
farmers and their progress is easy to follow. In the preceding
chapter, covering the early history of the American Indian, we
were dealing with elusive hunters. We saw not a single Indian;
only dim, mysterious shapes sifting through a forest of question
marks. But now we are dealing with farmers and we shall have
solid substance on which to build our story.</p>
<p>The trail of farmers is easier to follow. They have a dependable
food supply and live in one spot for generations. They
build villages and cities, and best of all, excellent garbage piles.
Nothing delights the archeologist as much as a big pile of trash
for every piece is a paragraph in the story of a people. If he
can find the things people have used, worn out and discarded
the archeologist can reconstruct their lives to an amazing
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
degree. Hunters seldom pile up their trash but farmers are
more obliging. Living for generations in a village they carry
it outside and dump it in one nice big pile. And in those successive
layers of trash is the story of the people. The archeologist
revels in it. Except for the professional garbage collector
he is probably the only person in the world who is thankful
for trash.</p>
<p>Excavation of ruins and trash piles has revealed that the
Mesa Verde region was occupied by farming Indians from about
the beginning of the Christian Era, possibly somewhat earlier,
until almost 1300 A.D. For convenience this long occupation
has been divided into four archeological periods. Actually there
were no abrupt breaks between these periods. Once the farming
Indians settled in the area they developed steadily and there
was constant progress until the climax was reached.</p>
<p>Dividing the occupation into periods makes it much easier,
however, to follow the progress of the people. Various archeologists
have used different names for the periods but we shall
use a system that was developed by Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts,
of the Smithsonian Institution. Dates for the various periods
vary somewhat in different parts of the Pueblo area but those
used here serve well for the Mesa Verde itself.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Basket Maker Period. 1 to 450 A.D.</dt>
<dt>Modified Basket Maker Period. 450 to 750 A.D.</dt>
<dt>Developmental Pueblo Period. 750 to 1100 A.D.</dt>
<dt>Great Pueblo Period. 1100 to 1300 A.D.</dt></dl>
<p>The fact that the first two periods are called &ldquo;Basket Maker&rdquo;
and the last two &ldquo;Pueblo&rdquo; should not be considered as an indication
that there was a difference in the people themselves.
Many years ago it was felt that during the eighth century there
was a change in the physical type but this idea has been discarded.
The people as well as their culture seem to have progressed
in an unbroken line. It should be noted, also, that the
dates are not rigid and they do not indicate abrupt, easily discerned
cultural changes.</p>
<h3 id="c11">BASKET MAKER PERIOD. 1 to 450 A.D.</h3>
<p>The Basket Makers were the earliest farmers in the Mesa
Verde area. Their culture was comparatively simple and was
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
featured by excellent weaving, especially of baskets and bags.
Because of this trait they were called Basket Makers by the
early explorers and the name has stuck. Credit for recognizing
and naming these early people goes to Richard Wetherill, whom
we have already met. In 1893, the Wetherills were digging in a
great cave in Butler Wash, in southeastern Utah. While digging
in the natural sand floor of the cave Richard found a burial pit,
then another and another. When the excavation of the cave was
completed the Wetherills had found ninety burials and in many
cases the bodies were well mummified because of the drying
effect of the cave sand.</p>
<p>The men were immediately impressed by the fact that the
ninety graves had yielded no pottery. Previously they had excavated
extensively in the Mesa Verde where the graves always
contained pottery. But not a single piece was found with the
burials in Butler Wash. Instead, the burials yielded a profusion
of baskets. For this reason Richard began referring to the
people as the &ldquo;Basket Makers&rdquo; and the name is still in use.</p>
<p>Few evidences of the early Basket Makers have been found
in the Mesa Verde. The remains of these people are found in
caves and Mesa Verde caves contain cliff dwellings. In order
to find the early remains it will be necessary to excavate under
the cliff dwellings and this work is yet to be done. However, the
Basket Makers seem to have occupied the entire Mesa Verde
region and when it becomes possible to excavate under the cliff
dwellings the material probably will be found. Even though few
evidences of the Basket Makers have been discovered in the
Mesa Verde the culture is well known from extensive excavation
in nearby areas.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Basket Maker period the people seem
to have lived a seminomadic life. They had only recently taken
up farming and at first they probably farmed incidentally, regarding
it only as a novel side line. Its possibilities became
more and more apparent with each harvest and conditions were
soon reversed. Farming became the mainstay and hunting became
the side line. After the people fully realized the advantages
of agriculture they never returned to a hunting life.
Their main dependence was on the harvests and hunting was
secondary in importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Our first recognition of these people brings up an interesting
problem. Were they living in the Mesa Verde region as
hunters when corn and squash came to them from some other
tribe or did they bring these plants from some other region
where they had already learned to farm? The answer is not
yet known so we can simply say that when we first recognize
them in the Mesa Verde area they were turning from a hunting
to a farming life.</p>
<p>Physically, the Basket Makers were an interesting group.
A large number of their burials have been found so their physical
appearance is not in doubt. They were rather short in stature,
the women averaging about five feet and the men three or four
inches taller. The skin color varied from light to dark brown
and it is safe to say that their eyes were also brown. The hair
was black, sometimes rusty black and occasionally was inclined
toward a slight waviness. On the mummies that have been found
the hair of the women usually is cropped short but the male
mummies sometimes exhibit elaborate hair styling. On some
a wide line was shaved down the center of the head and the remaining
hair was done up in a number of large and small braids.</p>
<p>If we could have walked through a Basket Maker village we
probably would have considered the people rather attractive
even when viewed from our own standards. They would have
seemed short to us but well proportioned. Their features would
have been pleasing for there would have been none of the amazing
skull deformities which we saw among the people of Cliff Palace.
Everything indicates they were a peaceful, easygoing people
and, in all probability, they would have been easy to like.</p>
<p>From a cultural viewpoint the Basket Makers are important
because of their lack of certain very important traits. During
their early farming stages they did not make pottery, did not
use the bow and arrow, and did not have permanent houses except
in one area which we shall mention in a moment.</p>
<p>The lack of houses and pottery was perfectly natural for they
had only recently been a hunting people. While they lived as
hunters they were forced to move about in search of game and
a permanent house was an impossibility. Pottery was also out
of the question for it was too heavy for them to transport as
they moved about. The absence of the bow was simply due to
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
the fact that it had not yet reached these people. The bow probably
was invented only once. From its point of beginning somewhere
in the Old World it spread slowly from tribe to tribe and we
shall see it reach the Basket Makers at a later date.</p>
<p>All people need shelter, household utensils and weapons so,
lacking houses, pottery and the bow, our Basket Makers used
substitutes. As is always the case they were inferior.</p>
<p>Part of the time, probably during the cold seasons, the Basket
Makers lived in caves. These offered shelter from the elements
and provided safe, dry places for the storage of food. The women
built their fires in level sheltered areas and around these fires
centered most of the activities. In the rear of the cave they
constructed storage cists for their corn. Small pits were dug
in the cave floor and were lined with slabs of sandstone chinked
with bark and mud. Over the pit was placed a roof of poles and
packed earth, leaving only a small hatchway which was closed
with a thin stone slab. Such cists were secure and dry and served
as excellent storage bins for the year&rsquo;s harvest of corn. When
the people left the cave for any length of time they could conceal
the storage pits by covering them over with earth and stones so
they would not be detected by chance visitors.</p>
<p>Even though most of the Basket Maker remains have been
found in caves it is probable that they lived in the open near
their fields for at least part of the year. As farming became
more important to them they were forced to protect their crops.
Each farm needed to be watched carefully to prevent damage
by birds and mammals or even by men of other groups. Because
of this necessity of living near their fields it is probable that
they erected temporary shelters for protection from the sun
and rain. A mere framework of poles covered with brush and
grass would have sufficed. No trace of these temporary shelters
has been found but there is a strong feeling that they did exist.</p>
<p>Recent excavations have revealed that in one area the Basket
Makers began experimenting with permanent houses at an earlier
date than formerly had been realized. Near Durango, Colorado,
Mr. Earl H. Morris, of the Carnegie Institution, excavated a
number of house structures, both in caves and on open hillsides,
which date from the first and second centuries A.D. While
these houses were crude when compared with the standardized
pithouses which later came into wide use, they do indicate that
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
the Basket Makers, in that area at least, began to experiment
with permanent structures soon after they became a farming
people. Further excavation may reveal that crude, hogan-like
structures were in general use at an earlier date than has been
realized.</p>
<p>The absence of pottery during Basket Maker times resulted
in a widespread use of baskets and, as the name implies, basketry
was the major craft. Many of the baskets of this period are
superb examples of workmanship and design. Skillfully woven,
artistically decorated and gracefully shaped they are outstanding
among the basketry of the early Indians. Shallow trays were
the most common form but there were also bowls, water baskets,
deep carrying baskets and small baskets which probably served
for storing trinkets and ceremonial objects. Large, flexible
bags were also woven and these were often split open and used
as burial wrappings.</p>
<p>Since pottery was unknown baskets were used for all household
purposes where containers were needed. Some were so
tightly woven that water could be carried and stored in them
and, surprisingly, food was cooked in them. Cooking in a basket
was a tedious affair. Stones were placed in the fire and when
they were very hot were dropped into the basket of food. When
the stones cooled they were replaced with more hot stones until
the cook&rsquo;s fingers were thoroughly burned and her patience was
exhausted. Half-cooked &ldquo;stew-a-la-ashes&rdquo; was the inevitable
result. It was a crude, inefficient method and greatly limited
the cooking possibilities.</p>
<p>Lack of the bow and arrow forced the Basket Makers to rely
on an odd weapon, the atlatl, which was as difficult to use as it
is to pronounce. It was used in many parts of the world before
the bow took its place. The atlatl was a spear thrower which
served as a mechanical lengthener for the arm. It was a slender,
flattened stick about two feet in length. At one end was the
grip, equipped with two loops for the fingers. At the opposite
end, on the upper face, was a short spur or hook, against which
the dart or spear rested.</p>
<p>The dart, either a reed or a slender shaft of wood, was four
or five feet long. One end was tipped with a stone point: the
other end was feathered and this basal end was cup-shaped to
fit against the spur on the atlatl. In reality the dart was merely
a long arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>When the hunter was ready to use the atlatl he held it in his
hand with his first two fingers through the finger loops. The
end of the dart was hooked against the spur at the rear end of
the atlatl and the arm was drawn back with the atlatl extending
out behind, horizontally. From this position the arm was thrown
sharply forward in a long sweeping arc and the dart was projected
from the end of the atlatl. In this way the length of the
arm was doubled and great force was imparted to the missile.</p>
<p>Even though the atlatl was a powerful weapon it had certain
bad points. Accuracy was difficult to achieve and it was not well
adapted for use in stalking game. The hunter was forced to
stand erect and be free of bushes and trees in order to throw
the dart. Later we shall see the people discard the atlatl in
favor of a superior weapon.</p>
<p>In addition to the atlatl another wooden implement was in
common use. This was a short, curved stick about two feet long
which was much like the throwing stick used by modern Hopis
in killing rabbits. While the exact use of the curved stick is
not known the fact that it is so often found with the atlatl must
indicate that the two comprised the hunting or fighting equipment
of the men.</p>
<p>The atlatl was a poor weapon for use in hunting small game
so nets and snares were widely used. The nets, made of yucca
fiber and human hair cord, were sometimes over two hundred
feet long and three or four feet wide. Such nets probably were
stretched across game trails or small canyons and the game
was driven into them by groups of men who would then club the
trapped animals. Dogs, which the people seem to have had from
the very first, may have been used in the game drives. These
were not just tamed wolves or coyotes, but true dogs which had
been brought across from Asia.</p>
<p>Clothing of the Basket Makers can best be described as
scanty. A great many well-preserved mummies have been found
and since it was customary to place the personal possessions
of the deceased in the grave we can assume that no articles of
clothing have escaped us completely. The total wardrobe seems
to have consisted of robes and sandals for people of all ages
and, occasionally, small string aprons for the women.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>The Basket Maker country was cold in winter, temperatures
sometimes dropping as low as zero. Since there were few, if
any, houses except in the one area mentioned above, some articles
of clothing were needed during the winter months. In every
case these seem to have been robes made of animal skins.
Sometimes they were simply the tanned hides of deer, mountain
sheep or elk. The finest robes, however, were woven from
strips of fur. Rabbit skins were cut into long narrow strips
which were wound around yucca cords to produce fur-covered
strings. These were woven into robes which, when wrapped
around the body, gave the wearer considerable protection against
the winter&rsquo;s cold. Beautiful sashes were woven from dog hair
and these probably were used to hold the robes and blankets in
place.</p>
<p>Sandals evidently were common for a great many have been
found in Basket Maker caves. These were woven of yucca fibers
or yucca fiber cords and consisted simply of a square-toed,
flat sole which was held to the foot by tie strings.</p>
<p>The only other article of clothing was a small string apron
worn by the women. This consisted of a cord or belt which was
tied around the waist and from this hung scores or hundreds of
strings. The fringe of strings was only a few inches wide so it
evidently covered only the front of the wearer. Sometimes the
strings were long enough to pass between the legs and be looped
over the waist band at the back. The number of aprons found is
not large and it may indicate that they were worn only at times
of occasional necessity.</p>
<p>Present evidence indicates that except for sandals the Basket
Makers wore little clothing during the warm season. When winter
came the fur and skin robes, of which there seem to have been
an abundance, provided protection from the cold.</p>
<p>What the people lacked in clothing they made up in jewelry.
Beads, necklaces, pendants and earrings are found in profusion
in the graves and there can be no doubt that the people had a
strong desire for personal adornment. The materials used seem
quite drab to us but from such ordinary materials as shell, bone,
seeds and brightly-colored stones, jewelry of lasting beauty was
fashioned.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>The Basket Maker cradle was entirely different from the
wooden cradle we saw used in Cliff Palace. It was a soft flexible
affair made of reeds and withes. A long stick was bent into
a loop and the ends were tied together to form an oval frame.
To this was bound a layer of reeds or slender withes and the
cradle was then padded with soft bark or fur. When the baby
was bound to the cradle a soft pad was placed under its head
and the skull developed normally without being flattened.</p>
<p>Many additional tools of wood, stone and bone are found
when Basket Maker caves are excavated: wooden planting
sticks and scoops; stone knives, scrapers, drills and pipes;
bone awls, scrapers and whistles. An important item was the
metate, or milling stone. This was a slab of stone with a shallow
trough on the top surface. Corn was placed on the metate
and ground with the mano, a small stone which was rubbed
back and forth in the trough.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things about the Basket Makers was
the manner in which they buried their dead and, surprisingly
enough, it is because of this that we have our present knowledge
of the early people. All burials which have been found up to the
present time have been found in caves, although it is possible
that bodies were sometimes buried in other places. A favorite
place for burial seems to have been the cists which originally
were built for the storage of food. When these were not available
graves were dug in the cave floor or the bodies were placed in
holes and crevices in the rocks. Often several bodies were buried
together and as many as nineteen have been found in a single
grave. The bodies were flexed, with the arms and legs drawn
up against the chest. Blankets were wrapped around them and
sometimes the burial bundle was placed in a large woven bag.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the archeologist it was customary to place
offerings in the grave and these consisted of articles the deceased
had used or articles his spirit would need in the afterworld.
Even though burial took place almost 2000 years ago the
dry caves have preserved the materials amazingly well and as
a result we have not only the mummified remains of the people
but all of the articles which were in daily use centuries ago.</p>
<p>We have seen briefly the outstanding traits of the Basket
Maker culture. Summing them up, we see a tribe of Indians living
in the Mesa Verde region at the beginning of the Christian
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
Era. Formerly hunters, they turned more and more to farming,
raising corn and squash on the mesa tops or in open canyon bottoms.
Having no permanent houses they sought the shelter of
caves and since pottery was unknown baskets were widely used.
The atlatl, or spear thrower, was used instead of the bow. Minor
arts and crafts enabled the people to live a comparatively well-rounded
life.</p>
<p>The noteworthy point is that from this simple beginning developed
the amazing Pueblo culture which reached its peak in the
thirteenth century. Since the people were industrious and intelligent
they progressed steadily, following the same trail which
all people have taken in their climb toward civilization. In the
early stages progress was slow but with the acquisition of each
new idea the pace quickened.</p>
<p>The great step forward was the abandonment of the chase,
the acceptance of a settled farming life. Within a short time
they became firmly established agriculturists. Their main dependence
for food was soon on their farms, and wild animals
and plants became a secondary source.</p>
<p>The change to a farming life revolutionized the entire culture.
As the source of food changed the religious, social and
economic life also changed. The religion of hunters could never
suffice for farmers. The men viewed rain, snow, the soil, the
sun, frosts and the changing seasons through the eyes of farmers
instead of through the eyes of hunters. All events of nature were
interpreted according to their effect upon agriculture. New social
regulations grew out of the settled existence and the entire
outlook on life was different.</p>
<p>Even though progress was slow at first some startling
changes came. About the middle of the fifth century some of
the changes were so important that the culture was radically
modified. A new descriptive term must now be used in order
to indicate these new developments.</p>
<h3 id="c12">MODIFIED BASKET MAKER PERIOD. 450 to 750 A.D.</h3>
<p>Even though the culture changed the people themselves did
not. It is extremely important to keep in mind the fact that the
Modified Basket Makers were merely the descendants of the
true Basket Makers. They added new material things to their
culture, thus modifying it, but they themselves changed not one
particle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>To state it briefly, it can be said that the change in name has
been made because the people acquired the things which were
mentioned as lacking during the earlier period. They learned
to make pottery, they began to build houses and they adopted the
bow and arrow. Thus the true basket making culture changed.
The weaving of baskets continued but the addition of pottery modified
the culture and this is indicated in the new name.</p>
<p>It is important to note that all three of the new developments
did not appear at exactly the same time nor did they reach all
of the Basket Makers at the same time. They spread from one
group to the next. They were slow in getting to some regions
or, since there are conservatives among all people, perhaps
some of the Basket Makers were hesitant about accepting the
new-fangled contraptions.</p>
<p>It is extremely doubtful if the Basket Makers invented a single
one of the important new things. New inventions usually were
passed from one tribe to another: often an intricate contrivance
such as the bow and arrow traveled all over the world after a
single invention. The Basket Makers did a certain amount of
traveling and trading and they were not averse to borrowing new
ideas from their neighbors.</p>
<p>It seems fairly certain that pottery came to them from the
south where other tribes had been making it prior to its arrival
in the Mesa Verde region. Some of the Basket Maker men, while
on a trading expedition, may have seen women making vessels
out of clay. Realizing the superiority of these vessels which
could be placed directly on the fire the men mentioned the matter
to their wives upon their return home. Possessed only of the
idea, the women began trying to make pottery.</p>
<p>They were practically forced to invent pottery all over again
for they knew nothing about the actual process. They had merely
heard that fine vessels could be made from clay. Their first
attempts were extremely clumsy and resulted in absolute failure.
They made the first pots from pure clay and as fast as it
dried the vessels cracked and fell into pieces. After a time the
women realized they must add something to the clay to hold it
together. Straw and juniper bark were tried and there was a
certain measure of success. The vessels had less tendency to
crack but when they were placed on the fire the straw burned
out and the result was more in the nature of a sieve than a pot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>The patient women continued to experiment and at last they
learned that some kind of sand or grit was necessary for temper.
In several places in the Mesa Verde volcanic formations
provided the potters with an abundance of volcanic grit. When
this was ground fine and added to the pottery clay the vessels
did not crack upon drying. The first pieces of pottery were
merely sun dried but soon the women learned that if they were
subjected to intense heat they were much stronger and were
waterproof. Each vessel was carefully baked, or fired, and true
pottery was the result.</p>
<p>The effect of pottery upon the food habits of the people was
profound. With vessels that could be placed directly on the fire
whole new lines of food were available. Soups, stews, porridges
and greens became commonplace. Many new plants were utilized
and innumerable combinations of meats and plants were discovered.
Pottery was also of great value for water storage. Baskets
were not good for this because the moisture soon caused
them to disintegrate. Pottery lasted indefinitely and each woman
could make an unlimited number of large water jars. On rainy
days every jar in the village could be filled and the terrors of
drouth were lessened.</p>
<p>Thus it is easily seen that the perfection of pottery was one
of the major steps in the progress of the Indians. The diet was
improved, the drudgery of cooking was lessened, the range of
foods was widened, storage facilities were increased and the
entire domestic economy of the people took a decided turn for
the better.</p>
<p>At first the pottery was crude but with each succeeding generation
it improved. The proper percentage of temper and clay
was discovered, designs were introduced and improved upon and
vessel shapes became more graceful and efficient. As time
passed the fingers of the potters became more and more deft.</p>
<p>The adoption of a permanent house was also of great importance.
Life in the open caves was never too comfortable. Heavy
rains, deep snows and the bitter temperatures of winter held
certain terrors for the people who were without actual dwellings.
No great population could ever grow under such conditions. A
permanent, secure house was needed to stabilize the culture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>As we have already seen, the Basket Makers in at least one
area began to experiment with permanent houses at an early
date. It is not yet known whether these earliest houses developed
into the standardized pithouses which spread widely over
the area early in Modified Basket Maker times but we may be
quite sure the people did not develop it entirely by themselves.
Similar pithouses were used by Indians in many parts of America,
in fact they can be traced up the northwest coast and on to
Alaska and Siberia. Since this type of house was used so widely
it is probable that the Basket Makers borrowed the idea from
some neighboring tribe.</p>
<p>The dwellings were pithouses, partially above and partially
below the ground. The underground portion consisted of a shallow
pit two or three feet in depth and ten to twenty feet in diameter.
Sometimes the earthen walls were plastered with clay, or
if the walls had a tendency to cave they were lined with stone
slabs. In the floor, forming a large square, four holes were dug
and a forked post slightly higher than a man&rsquo;s head was set upright
in each. Four slender logs were placed in the forks of
these posts forming a square framework, the main support of
the roof. Slender poles were slanted from the edge of the pit to
this framework at twelve or fifteen inch intervals, entirely
around the room. Other poles were placed across the flat, top
portion to complete the skeleton of the roof.</p>
<p>To this framework was lashed a solid covering of reeds,
brush, bark or coarse grass and the entire roof was covered
with a layer of earth several inches thick. A small hatchway
was left in the center of the roof. This served as a smoke hole
and it was often equipped with a ladder and used as an entrance.
The firepit was in the center of the room below the smoke hole.</p>
<p>Since the pithouse needed ventilation a tunnel was dug through
the south wall and brought to the surface a few feet south of the
house. Sometimes this tunnel served merely as a ventilator and
crawl entrance but usually the end was enlarged into a room.
This second room was always smaller than the main room but
it was roofed in much the same manner. In reality a house of
this type consisted of the large main room and a smaller antechamber,
the two being connected by a tunnel. The location of
the antechamber door is uncertain. Probably there was a hatchway
in the roof or there may have been a door in one of the side
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
walls. It is certain that the fire in the main room drew fresh
air from the antechamber for just in front of the tunnel entrance
was placed a large stone slab which served as a deflector. This
slab kept the current of fresh air from blowing across the fire
and, in the winter, prevented cold air from sweeping across the
floor where people were sleeping.</p>
<p>The sipapu, a small hole in the floor near the firepit, made
its appearance at this time. This feature has continued in use
to the present day for some of the modern Pueblo Indians have
similar holes in the floors of their kivas. It serves as a symbolic
entrance to the Mother Earth and its importance is indicated
by the fact that it has persisted for so many centuries.</p>
<p>Many of the earliest pithouses, perhaps the very first ones,
were built in caves. The people had used the caves for centuries
and it was only natural that they should build houses there. Within
a short time, however, there was a movement toward the open
country and soon pithouse villages were being built on the mesa
tops and in open valleys. The caves, although they provided
shelter from the winter&rsquo;s storms, were cold and uncomfortable
for the sun shone in only a few hours each day. With substantial
houses the people no longer feared the rigors of winter and
life in the open was far more pleasant than in the cold, shadowy
caves. By the seventh century most of the people seem to have
moved out of the caves and they were seldom used until the time
when the cliff dwellings were built.</p>
<p>One of the far-reaching effects of the permanent house was
its influence on true family life. Before this time the people
probably had lived in haphazard groups with little opportunity
for development of the true family. The house changed all this.
In most instances a small pithouse probably served as the dwelling
place of a single family and this gave new meaning to the
family as a compact unit. Family ties, relationships and inheritance
probably took on new meanings.</p>
<p>As generations passed the houses improved and toward the
end of the period an important development came. For some
time the people had built slab-lined storage rooms around their
pithouses. At first they were small but gradually they were enlarged
until they could serve as living rooms. The floor was
slightly below ground level and the walls of the pit were lined
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
with stone slabs. The above-ground walls were built of poles
and adobe and the flat roof was of similar materials. The rooms
became rectangular and the side walls vertical making it possible
to join them together in long rows. At the end of the period
many of the villages consisted of long rows of living rooms in
front of which were a few of the old-type pithouses. These pithouses
grew deeper and gradually seem to have developed into
ceremonial rooms. This was the beginning of the kiva, a subterranean
room which is still used for this purpose by present-day
Pueblo Indians. Ruins of the type described above are called
slab-house villages because of the stone slabs which lined the
walls of the living rooms.</p>
<p>The third cultural trait which set the Modified Basket Makers
apart from their ancestors, the Basket Makers, was the bow and
arrow. Again the people borrowed. The bow and arrow is such
a complicated combination that it is easier to believe it was invented
once, then spread over the world, than that it was invented
several times by different people. The invention occurred
in the Old World and the weapon was brought to America by many
bands of immigrants.</p>
<p>The Indians of the Mesa Verde received the bow and arrow
after they had acquired houses and pottery. Some band of wandering
Indians probably brought the new weapon into the region
and the people may have obtained it by peaceful borrowing. Or
they may have recognized the superiority of the bow through
the sad experience of trying to defend themselves with their
atlatls. Whatever the circumstances may have been they adopted
the bow and the atlatl was discarded.</p>
<p>The bow excelled the atlatl in every way. It had greater accuracy
and was well adapted for stalking game or defending the
home since it could be shot from almost any position. Brush
and trees did not interfere with its use as in the case of the atlatl
which could be used only where there was room for the overhead
sweep of the arm. Arrows were shorter than atlatl darts, easier
to carry and their range was greater. The bow was also more
efficient in the killing of small game.</p>
<p>As is always the case the old gave way to the new. The bow
was accepted and soon mastered. Defense of the home was easier,
hunting was more efficient and more game animals were
killed than had been possible with the atlatl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>An extremely important point that must be remembered is
that the house, pottery and the bow did not all arrive at the same
time. It must not be considered that on a certain day, in a certain
year, the Basket Makers voted to accept the new things and become
Modified Basket Makers. These new cultural traits filtered
in slowly and the people themselves little realized how
their culture was changing.</p>
<p>During this period beans came up from the south and were
accepted eagerly by the farmers. It is entirely possible that
this acceptance was made possible by the new cooking vessels
which the people now possessed. At an altitude of 7000 feet dry
beans require several hours of boiling and while the people
cooked in baskets this would have been virtually impossible.
Pottery cooking vessels made the task easy, however, and the
beans, an excellent protein food, gave the people a more balanced
diet. New varieties of corn also appeared. Previously only red
corn had been grown but now other colors became common.</p>
<p>During this period other cultural changes of a minor nature
occurred. Hafted stone mauls and axes appeared, the latter
being vitally necessary for cutting the many poles used in house
construction. The turkey was domesticated and feather blankets,
which had first appeared in the preceding period, became increasingly
common. Jewelry was much the same as in earlier
times except that turquoise came into use and this gave the
people an additional stone from which to make beads, pendants
and earrings.</p>
<p>The popularity of baskets was in no way lessened by the appearance
of pottery and some of the finest baskets were made
at this time. Sandals improved in quality and the shape changed
slightly. In the preceding period the sandals were square-toed
but now the toe became V-shaped, or scalloped. Often the sandals
were elaborately decorated with colored designs and with
designs produced by variations in the weave.</p>
<p>There is much evidence that the culture became more and
more stabilized with each succeeding generation. Farming
methods improved and the harvests became more abundant.
With dependable supplies of food, the added comfort and security
of the dwellings and the improvement of living conditions the
population increased. By the early part of the eighth century a
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
large population of farming Indians occupied the Mesa Verde
and surrounding regions. It must have been a peaceful time for
the villages were widely scattered over the mesas and open
valleys, evidently with little thought of concentration for safety.</p>
<p>Ruins of this period are found in abundance in the Mesa Verde.
Scores of pithouse and slab-house villages have been found on
the mesa tops and one pithouse village has been found in a cave.
In most cases pithouses which were built in caves are now underneath
the cliff dwellings which were built later. Step House Cave,
however, proved to be an exception. In this cave, located in Long
Canyon, the cliff dwelling occupies only the north end of the cave
leaving a large clear space at the south end. This area was covered
with several feet of trash which the occupants of the cliff
dwelling had thrown out. In 1926, Supt. Jesse L. Nusbaum excavated
under this trash layer and found three pithouses which
had been built about 600 A.D. This discovery indicates that
some of the early pithouses were built in caves and that excavation
under some of the cliff dwellings should reveal further
evidence of cave occupation during Modified Basket Maker times.</p>
<h3 id="c13">DEVELOPMENTAL PUEBLO PERIOD. 750 to 1100 A.D.</h3>
<p>As we move into this new period it should be stressed that
there was no radical change in the culture. The same people
continued to occupy the Mesa Verde and they showed the same
progressive tendencies which we have seen in the earlier periods.</p>
<p>At this time, however, the people did a surprising thing. They
adopted a new cradle. Offhand, this may not seem especially
important but it had a startling effect and early archeologists
were confronted with a baffling problem. The new cradle caused
such a radical change in the appearance of the Indians that until
recently the archeologists thought a new people had moved into
the region.</p>
<p>When the Basket Makers first were recognized half a century
ago it was noticed immediately that their skulls were strikingly
different from those of the people who had lived in pueblos and
cliff dwellings. Skulls of the Basket Makers were longer and
narrower and there was no deformity on the back. In contrast,
skulls of the later people were broad and this broadness was
emphasized by a flattening on the back, a deformity caused by
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
the hard cradle board. The head shape was so radically different
that early archeologists assumed a new, broad-headed
people had moved into the region during the eighth century and
merged with the Basket Makers.</p>
<p>As southwestern archeology progressed through uncertain
early years this assumption that the Basket Makers and Pueblos
were two different people was generally accepted. In those
early days there was not enough skeletal material for an exhaustive
comparative study and while many questions were unanswered
and doubts were often expressed by archeologists,
the separate identity of the Basket Makers and Pueblos was
generally accepted.</p>
<p>Now the story has changed. Recent intensive study of a
large amount of skeletal material, ranging from the ancient
Basket Makers to recent Pueblo Indians, has thrown new light
on the problem. The result is that after all these years it now
becomes apparent that there was no radical change of physical
type at all. The Basket Maker type seems to have persisted
with little evidence of any great addition of new blood.</p>
<p>The radical change in the shape of the heads seems to have
resulted from the new cradle which the people adopted during
the eighth century. The soft, padded cradle of the Basket
Makers was discarded and within a short time all of the women
of the tribe were using a cradle made of wood. No pillow was
placed under the baby&rsquo;s head and the result was inevitable. The
back of the head flattened, the sides bulged and a broad, deformed
head resulted.</p>
<p>How can this change of cradles be explained except by saying
that it was a craze, a new beauty fad which caught the fancy
of the people. Where it came from is not known: surely it must
have been borrowed from other people with whom the Basket
Makers came in contact. Evidently the new head shape became
fashionable for within a short time the new cradle was adopted
throughout the area. Instead of changing the hat or &ldquo;hairdo&rdquo;,
as is the custom among modern people, they went to the very
root of the matter and changed the shape of the skull itself.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>From this time on we are going to know the people as Pueblo
Indians. &ldquo;Pueblo&rdquo; is a Spanish word meaning village, or town,
and was applied by the early Spaniards to Indians whom they
found living in large, compact, many-roomed villages. It is an
excellent term, as far as architecture is concerned, for from
the eighth century on the Indians of the Mesa Verde showed an
increasing tendency to join their houses together to form compact
villages. The term, Developmental Pueblo period, means
exactly what it says. It was a time of development and expansion
and during this period the groundwork was laid for the
Great Pueblo period which followed.</p>
<p>Once again we should stress a very important point. Even
though we have changed names, even though we have stepped
from the Modified Basket Maker to the Developmental Pueblo
period there was no abrupt cultural change. The only real difference
as we move from one period to the next is in the appearance
of the people. Because of the adoption of the hard
cradle their heads became broad and deformed but otherwise
the changes were gradual and it is difficult to draw a sharp line
between the two periods.</p>
<p>During the Developmental Pueblo period there was the same
gradual development in all lines that we have seen throughout
the earlier periods. The people were alert and curious: they
were energetic and ambitious and the result was steady development.
It was a period of peace and the people seem to have
lived without fear of an enemy. The caves were deserted and
villages were built on the open mesa tops or in broad valleys
near the fields of corn, beans and squash which provided them
with food in abundance. The population grew rapidly and spread
over a vast area in the Four Corners region where Colorado,
Utah, Arizona and New Mexico now meet at a common point. It
was a far-flung culture and there is every evidence that for a
long time there was peace and prosperity among the people.</p>
<p>The most important development during this period was in
the field of architecture. At the end of the previous period most
of the villages consisted of groups of individual pithouses.
Some of the villages, however, were made up of long curving
rows of flat-roofed houses built of poles, stone slabs and adobe.
In front of the living rooms were one or more pithouses which
probably served as ceremonial rooms.</p>
<p>At first the Developmental Pueblo villages were merely
continuations of these earlier villages. As time passed improvements
came, indicating that the builders were doing a
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
great deal of experimenting. Walls of many types were built
and with each generation there was progress. During this period
the population of the Mesa Verde evidently was large for the
mesa tops are dotted with scores, perhaps hundreds, of ruins.</p>
<p>Recently five ruins dating from this period have been excavated
in the Mesa Verde. Two of the ruins are at the Twin
Trees site, with one ruin sitting on top of the other. The other
three are less than three hundred yards away at Site 16. And
here again the ruins are piled up one on top of another. The
people showed a strong tendency to build villages on the ruins
of earlier villages.</p>
<p>The five ruins, taken in chronological order, show very
clearly the architectural progress of the Developmental Pueblo
period:</p>
<p><span class="u">850 A.D.</span> The first ruin is a slab-house pueblo. The floors
of the living rooms were a foot or more below ground level and
the earthen walls were lined with slabs. The upper walls consisted
of slender posts, set a few inches apart, with the intervening
spaces filled with adobe. In front of the long row of
living rooms were four pitrooms, each one being about six feet
deep. The roof of each pitroom was supported on four posts
set in the floor of the room.</p>
<p><span class="u">900 A.D.</span> The second ruin is a post-and-adobe pueblo. The
floors of the living rooms were not dug below ground level and
no stone slabs were used. The walls consisted of posts, set upright
a foot or more apart. The spaces between the posts were
filled with adobe into which had been forced many small stones.
In front of the living rooms was a kiva of a very early type.
The walls were of plastered native earth. The roof was supported
on four posts but instead of rising from the kiva floor
the posts were built into the face of a bench which encircled
the room.</p>
<p><span class="u">950 A.D.</span> The third ruin is a small masonry pueblo. The
walls were built of stones and adobe but the masonry was exceedingly
crude. The stones were irregular in shape and only
a few were laid in even rows. An excessive amount of adobe
was used; actually the walls were about fifty percent adobe
and fifty percent stone. In front of the living rooms was an
early type kiva. The walls were of plastered native earth and
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
the roof, instead of being supported on posts, was supported on
four stone pillars, or pilasters, which rested on the bench.</p>
<p><span class="u">1000 A.D.</span> The fourth ruin is a small pueblo built of single-coursed
masonry. The walls of the living rooms contain stones
which were well shaped but without smoothed faces. The stones
were laid in even rows but the walls were only the thickness of
a single stone, measuring less than a foot in width. The kiva,
which was located in front of the living rooms, approached the
standard Mesa Verde type. The walls below the bench were
faced with stone and the roof was supported by six stone pilasters
which rested on the bench.</p>
<p><span class="u">1075 A.D.</span> The fifth ruin is a pueblo built of thick, double-coursed
masonry. The faces of the stones were smoothed and
some retain the peck marks of the tools used in the shaping
process. Some of the walls were two stories high. The kiva,
located in front of the living rooms, was of excellent construction.
The roof was supported on eight stone pillars which rested
on the bench, and the walls, from the floor to the top of the pillars,
were faced with masonry of good quality. One new architectural
feature, the tower, appears in this ruin. There are
three of these tall, circular structures&mdash;we shall consider
them in a moment.</p>
<p>The five ruins demonstrate graphically the steady architectural
progress of the Developmental Pueblo period. In the
beginning the houses were crudely built of posts and adobe and
the underground rooms, which may not have been entirely ceremonial
at first, were merely deep pitrooms. At the end of the
period the houses were of good masonry and the standard Mesa
Verde kiva had developed. Certainly this development shows
that the people were constantly experimenting and as a result
the architecture improved steadily. During the latter part of
the period few large pueblos were built. Usually a village consisted
of a few living rooms joined together in a compact unit.
A short distance south of the living rooms was a single kiva.</p>
<p>Pottery also made rapid advances during this period. The
women had become convinced of its value and they experimented
endlessly, probably in a spirit of friendly competition. During
the preceding period pottery was dull gray in color and the
crudely painted designs did not contrast well with this drab
background. The women now learned to apply a thin wash of
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
white clay to the vessels. This wash or slip, as it is called,
produced a clear white background and against this the constantly
improving designs stood out in bold contrast. Corrugated
pottery appeared and vessels of this type were used
chiefly for cooking purposes.</p>
<p>Good baskets still were made but pottery vessels were superior
to baskets for most purposes. As a result the quality
of the baskets began to decline. Sandals were much like those
of earlier periods except that the toes were rounded and there
was less elaborate decoration. Cotton came into use about the
middle of the period and loom-woven cloth made its appearance.
Recent experiments have indicated that cotton will not
grow in the Mesa Verde so it must have been imported from
warmer areas to the south.</p>
<p>Minor arts and crafts improved as the people became more
proficient in the use of bone, stone and wood. An interesting
change occurred in the metate, or milling stone, during this
period. Earlier metates were trough-shaped, with a shallow
groove for a grinding surface. Now a flat metate came into
use and the entire surface was used for grinding the corn.</p>
<p>As the Developmental Pueblo period ended, thousands of
peaceful farming Indians occupied the Mesa Verde and a vast
area around it. The population had grown steadily since earliest
Basket Maker times and the region may have known its
greatest population at this time or in the early part of the following
period. Most of the villages were small; usually they
consisted of a few living rooms and a single kiva. These villages
are often called unit pueblos and it has been suggested
that each one may have housed a number of closely related
families forming a single clan.</p>
<p>That the people were vigorous and ambitious is indicated by
the progress which they made. Now we see them nearing their
cultural peak and it is time for us to leave the Developmental
Pueblo period and move into the golden age of the Pueblos.</p>
<h3 id="c14">GREAT, OR CLASSIC PUEBLO PERIOD. 1100 to 1300 A.D.</h3>
<p>This period has often been called the golden age of the
Pueblo people. Before we go into it, however, we should make
some mention of the beginning date, 1100 A.D. Usually, in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
general Pueblo area, an earlier date is given for the beginning
of the period. One may very easily push it back fifty or one
hundred years, or even more, depending upon how the period
is defined.</p>
<p>Recent studies have produced some perplexing problems
concerning the architecture, pottery and movements of the
people during their last two or three centuries in the Mesa
Verde. It is hoped that within a short time some or all of these
problems will be solved. Since the uncertainties do exist we
shall, for our purposes here, lean rather heavily on the term
&ldquo;classic,&rdquo; which is often applied to this climax period. The
culture reached its classic development during the 1100-1300
A.D. period so we shall use those dates.</p>
<p>We saw the beginning of Pueblo development over a thousand
years earlier when the first grain of corn was planted
somewhere in the Mesa Verde region. From that simple beginning
we have seen the culture develop steadily without a
backward step. Now it has reached its peak and for two centuries
we shall see the people enjoy the results of their long
struggle for improvement. It is true that adverse influences
will affect the people and will cause a radical change in their
way of life. But this adversity will not affect the arts and crafts
and superior workmanship will continue to the very end of the
Mesa Verde occupation.</p>
<p>The massive stone walls were the finest ever built in the
Mesa Verde. The stones were carefully cut and were laid in
neat even courses. Many of the walls were smoothly plastered
and often they were decorated with brightly colored designs.
The villages were often very large: sometimes they contained
scores of rooms and rose to a height of four stories. Ceremonial
rooms were numerous: sometimes there were more
than a score in a single village. They were built after a definite
pattern, giving evidence of rigid ceremonial practices.</p>
<p>Pottery of the Great Pueblo period was superb with the
women of each area specializing in certain shapes and designs.
In the Mesa Verde the women produced pottery of two types,
the corrugated vessels which were used for cooking and for
storage of food and water, and the black-on-white bowls, jars,
ladles, kiva jars and mugs which were used for other purposes.
The decorated pottery was highly polished and the intricate and
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
carefully balanced black designs stood out in sharp contrast
against the glossy white background. For some unknown reason
the potters used a different material for their pottery paint
during this period. Previously they had used mineral paints in
producing their designs but now they used paint made from
plants. Thus the designs were simply carbon which the firing
process burned into the surface of the vessels.</p>
<p>During the two Pueblo periods basketry declined both in
popularity and in excellence. This is to be expected, however,
for pottery had taken its place to a great extent and it was not
as important as in Basket Maker times. Good baskets were
still woven in Great Pueblo times but they were fewer and the
lack of elaborate decorations probably indicates that their popularity
was waning. Sandals were still widely used but they too
declined in quality. Possibly the loss of quality in basketry affected
this closely allied craft.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth, often decorated in several colors, was produced
in abundance and exquisite jewelry was made from turquoise,
shell, bone and other materials. Even the minor tools
give evidence of patient industry and nimble fingers.</p>
<p>The Great Pueblo period was a remarkable climax to the
many centuries of cultural development which we have just
witnessed. As we study it, however, one significant fact is obvious.
It was a period of regimentation with the people moving
in certain well established grooves. Artists and craftsmen
were highly skilled but they all followed the same patterns.
There was little tendency on the part of the individual to strike
out by himself and develop new things. Individual initiative was
not strong and the religious and social life probably was rigidly
regulated.</p>
<p>As archeologists endeavor to reconstruct the events of the
Great Pueblo period they are confronted with some puzzling
problems concerning the general way of life of the people.
During the period the architectural layout of the villages
changed, the villages increased in size and their location
changed. In addition, the population began to decline and great
areas which had long been occupied were deserted. At first
glance it would seem that adverse conditions were affecting the
people but more work must be done before all of the problems
can be solved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>At the beginning of the period the population was widely
scattered and most of the villages were small unit pueblos
which have already been mentioned. The fact that the people
lived in small scattered villages would in itself indicate that no
danger threatened. Even more indicative of peaceful times is
the fact that the kiva was located outside the village walls. The
kiva, an underground room, was used primarily by the men.
The only exit was a small hatchway in the roof and through this
only one man could emerge at a time. If a raiding party had
surprised a small village while the men were in the kiva during
a ceremony or at night the results would have been tragic.</p>
<p>Early in the Great Pueblo period the people began to change
the location of the kiva. Soon, in most cases at least, the kiva
was placed inside the village and was surrounded by the houses.
No longer was the underground room a death trap in case of a
surprise raid.</p>
<p>At about the same time tall round towers came into use.
Sometimes they were built at the outer walls of the pueblo but
very often the tower was built beside the kiva and was connected
with it by an underground tunnel. The round tower, which stood
higher than the rest of the village, would have served admirably
as a lookout tower and connecting it with the men&rsquo;s room would
seem a natural development. It has been suggested that the
tower may have had some ceremonial use since it was connected
with the kiva. More practical, however, is the idea that
it was a watch tower which resulted from a defensive need. Or,
if one wishes to avoid taking sides, perhaps it served both
purposes.</p>
<p>Whatever was affecting the people now seems to have caused
life in small villages to be less desirable for as we move
farther into the Great Pueblo period we see the pueblos increase
in size. It is true that some small pueblos were still in
use but one of the outstanding characteristics of the period was
the concentration of the population in pueblos of great size.</p>
<p>An excellent example of this concentration is to be seen in
the great Montezuma Valley which lies to the north and west of
the Mesa Verde. At an earlier date the Pueblo Indians who occupied
this valley lived in many small villages. During the
Great Pueblo period the people seem to have banded together
to form large communities. A number of enormous pueblos
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
were constructed and in many cases they were built around the
springs which supplied water for the populace.</p>
<p>In the Mesa Verde the trend was the same. At the beginning
of the period the people lived in numerous small pueblos. After
a time they began to band together and toward the end of the
twelfth century large pueblos were being built on the mesa tops
and in the broad, shallow drainages at the heads of canyons. In
some cases several small pueblos were built close together
while in other cases several small pueblos were clustered
around one or more large ones.</p>
<p>The next change was the most radical of all. About 1200
A.D., the people began to desert the mesa tops and within a
short time cliff dwellings were built in almost every cave in
the Mesa Verde. Shallow caves were available in great numbers
for the mesa contains a score of large canyons. The exact
number of cliff dwellings is not known but probably there are
as many as six or eight hundred in the canyons of the Mesa
Verde.</p>
<p>The events of the Great Pueblo period seem to indicate that
the people were faced with some danger which was not present
during the earlier periods. The change from small to large
pueblos indicates a need for security and the final move to the
caves must indicate a definite need for defense. Hundreds of
the caves were high on the cliff faces and many of them were
additionally fortified with defensive walls.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that during this period the security
of the people was threatened. Now we come to the most difficult
question of all. Who was the enemy? Against whom were
the people defending their homes? The complete answer is not
known but there appear to be two possibilities.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that during this period dissension
arose within the Pueblo group itself and the people began to war
against each other. This theory will be difficult to prove and
events of the period seem to argue against it. If the need for
defense resulted from trouble within the tribe one might well
expect the people to scatter even more widely with groups leaving
the heavily populated areas to seek safety in isolation. But
the people did just the opposite. Large areas were deserted
and the population became more concentrated than in any previous
period.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="594" />
<p class="pcap">Four small cliff dwellings with excellent defensive locations</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>This drawing together of the Pueblo people may well indicate
that the threat was from the outside and it is possible that
at this time nomadic Indians entered the area and began to
harass the farmers. Ceaseless raids of nomadic marauders
would exert tremendous pressure on a farming population and
withdrawal from the border lands and concentration in certain
favorable areas probably indicates a need for defense against
an outside enemy.</p>
<p>In 1540, when the Spaniards entered the Southwest, several
tribes of nomadic Indians were warring on the Pueblo people
and the population had dropped radically. When the Pueblo
population was at its height there were hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of villages but when the Spaniards came they found less
than eighty villages of Pueblo Indians and these were concentrated
in a small area in what is now New Mexico and Arizona.
Even after the Americans came the population continued to
dwindle. Finally there were fewer than thirty villages of Pueblo
Indians. Much of this loss of population was due to the harassing
activities of nomadic Indians and it is possible that in the
Mesa Verde area this trouble began about 1100 A.D.</p>
<p>The identity of the nomadic tribes which warred on the people
of the Mesa Verde region is not known. It has been suggested
that the early Apaches or the early Utes may have entered
the area at that time but there is little positive evidence.
Further research may provide an answer to the problem but it
is possible the identity of the &ldquo;enemy people&rdquo; will never be
known.</p>
<p>The Great Pueblo period came to an end just before 1300
A.D., and that is the time when the Pueblo Indians moved away
from the Mesa Verde, never to return. As was mentioned in
an earlier chapter the Pueblo Indian occupation of the Mesa
Verde came to an end during the great drought of 1276-1299
A.D. Rainfall was deficient during this period of twenty-four
years and before normal weather returned in the year 1300, all
of the people had drifted off to the south. Nothing has been
found to indicate that the Mesa Verde region was ever occupied
by farming Indians after the drouth.</p>
<p>Since the area was deserted during the drouth it is only
reasonable to assume that this period of abnormally dry weather
was the cause of their leaving. There is much, however, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
indicate that the drouth was not the sole cause. During their
long occupation of the Mesa Verde the Indians had survived
many long periods of drouth. Dry years were not a new experience
and they were wise in the ways of existing through
unfavorable periods. It is doubtful whether the drouth, severe
as it was, would have caused complete abandonment of so large
an area. We may feel sure that during the Great Pueblo period
a very real danger threatened the people. They moved to the
caves, certainly because of a need for security, and the population
diminished. Before the drouth came the people were already
moving to the south and it is probable that the abnormally
dry period simply hastened a movement that was already underway.
While the final, complete desertion of the area may be
blamed on the drouth it appears that the danger which had
threatened for more than a century had much to do with the
abandonment of the once populous area.</p>
<p>When normal weather returned in the year 1300, there were
no Pueblo Indians in the Mesa Verde. All had perished or had
drifted away and the villages were empty and silent. Slowly
the centuries paraded by. Drifting earth and vegetation crept
over the mesa-top pueblos and the leveling forces of nature
caused the once proud cliff dwellings slowly to bow their heads.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the silence of six centuries was broken and
the emptiness was gone. Men of a new race came upon the
scene and the modern world learned of the glorious past of the
Mesa Verde.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
